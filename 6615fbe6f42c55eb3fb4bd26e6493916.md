# Materials Needed

__A Decent Beginner Guitar__

Yamaha makes a great beginner guitar in my opinion: <a href="https://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/FG800-Folk-Acoustic-Guitar-Sand-Burst-1500000001825.gc">https://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/FG800-Folk-Acoustic-Guitar-Sand-Burst-1500000001825.gc</a>

They make a 3/4 size for kids: <a href="https://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/JR2-3-4-Scale-Folk-Guitar-Tobacco-Sunburst-1327507869492.gc">https://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/JR2-3-4-Scale-Folk-Guitar-Tobacco-Sunburst-1327507869492.gc</a>

__Extra Strings__

I recommend extra light gauge strings. But it's not absolutely necessary to change out your strings. Extra light strings are much easier to play than "12s" if you do decide to replace them. <a href="https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/acoustic-guitar/8020-bronze/ej10-8020-bronze-acoustic-guitar-strings-extra-light-10-47">https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/acoustic-guitar/8020-bronze/ej10-8020-bronze-acoustic-guitar-strings-extra-light-10-47</a>
