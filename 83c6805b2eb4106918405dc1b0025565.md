# Moveable E Major Shape

Check out this easy slow song: <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/slices/9hjDc/">https://www.soundslice.com/slices/9hjDc/</a>

We use the same E Major shape but at two other positions on the guitar.

For the "Aadd9" chord, your 1st finger lands on the 6th fret. But maintain the same E Major shape!

For the "Badd4" chord, your 1st finger lands on the 8th fret. And maintain the same E Major shape!

New Strumming Pattern (level 2) has two parts to it (1st measure and the 2nd measure).

The most important aspect of this strumming level practice is to tap your foot on the down beat! 

__TO DO:__ Review last week's chords and practice both strumming patterns while tapping your foot! Tapping your foot is the most important part!
