I recommend learning open position chords first when learning the guitar because they are a lot of fun to play. Within just a few days of practice, you build the skills to play along with your favorite songs. After about 12 weeks, you should be able to play most open position chords and play along with the song Hotel California.

The truth is that you can begin learning the guitar with any open position chord. Everyone will have their own path. I have created 

* The Em ("E Minor") module. You'll learn three two-finger chords (Em, CMaj7, G6) and one one-finger chord. Play along with two types of songs: Zombie by The Cranberries or Fine Line by Harry Styles.
* The E ("E Major") module. You'll actually learn three chords with one shape. The Climb by Miley Cyrus. Dreams by The Cranberries. Reaching Out To You by Snow Patrol. Flaws by San Cisco.
* The G ("G Major"), Cadd9, and D ("D Major") module. Parts of Sweet Child o Mine by Guns N Roses. Paperback Writer by The Beatles. Prisoners by John Denver. Heroes by David Bowie. Miss You So Much by Miley Cyrus.
* The A ("A Major"), D ("D Major"), and E ("E Major") module. Get Back by The Beatles. Yellow by Coldplay. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by U2. I Don't Want To Know by Fleetwood Mac. 
* The C ("C Major"), Am ("A Minor"), and D ("D Major") module. Laser Gun by M83. In Go
* The FMaj7 ("F Major 7") and Dm ("D Minor") module.
