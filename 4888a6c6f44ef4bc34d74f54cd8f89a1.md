# Tuning

This year I have 21 students who have never played the guitar before. So it takes some time getting everyone tuned. We end up only having a little bit of time left to play some music. So it's another short lesson!

# Easy fingerpicking - learning to stay on the beat

<a href="https://www.soundslice.com/slices/J8Wkc/">Watch the exercises with tab and notation here!</a>

## Exercise 1

Use the 1st (index or just "i") and 2nd (medio or just "m") fingers of the right hand. Listen and try to mimic! You are playing on every beat because these are called "quarter notes".

## Exercise 2

Again, use the "i" and the "m" fingers of the right hand. You are playing half notes which means each note gets two beats. Listen and try your best to mimic.

## Exercise 3

Again, use the 1st (index or just "i") and 2nd (medio or just "m") fingers of the right hand. These are whole notes. They take up the entire measure.

## Exercise 4

Introducing the thumb, "p" (pulgar). We will use the p, i, and m fingers of the right hand. The thumb will play the 3rd string. The index will play the 2nd string. And the middle finger will play the 1st string.

## Zombie by The Cranberries

You can use the pattern in __exercise 4__ to play over top of a fun 90's song called "Zombie". The song is a little faster than the exercise. Stay steady! 

Tip: Start when the drums come in.
