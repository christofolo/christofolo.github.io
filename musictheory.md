## Intro: You shouldn't JUST "play by ear". You need some music theory (ie. knowledge)

Imagine being a painter and not knowing the names of the colors. You just "paint by sight" and do what looks good. Now imagine if paintings were done by a "band of artists". It would be impossible to colaborate because you can't communicate your intentions to your bandmates.

Basic music theory is not complicated or hard to understand. Once you understand the fundamental patterns, everything will make sense. However, because everything in music is connected, it can be difficult to grasp even just the basics. I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite sized pieces. 

It may seem like I explain things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Notes are like colors

Sometimes, it can be useful to compare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting.

Artists can mix paints to create new colors. Musicians can do the same thing by playing multiple notes at the same time. When musicians make music with single notes, that is often called "melody". When musicians combine notes and play them at the same time, that is often called "harmony". Most beginners start with learning how to play harmony with common open-position chords like G major, D major, C major, etc.

Like colors, each pitch that is produced by an instrument has a name. However, some colors are called "dark" or "light" depending on their brightness. The colors "dark red" and "light red" are both red. The same thing happens in music. You can hear this interesting phenomenon on the guitar when you play each note on the A string.

If you play each and every fret on the A string, you'll notice that the note on the 12th fret "just fits" with the note played at the open string. Try playing the 12th fret of the A string while a Cello is "droning" on their "A" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpQ6c0NotCY). This is why we call the note at the 12th fret "A" as well. No, tt is NOT the same note...it just has the same name.

You can also hear this phenomenon when you play the 1st string (the one closest to your toes) and the 6th string (the one closest to your nose) at the same time. Both of these strings produce an "E". They should sound like they "fit". If the harmony is slightly "off", then perhaps one of your strings needs to be tuned!

Definitions to learn: consonance is the impression of stability and repose while dissonance is the impression of tension or clash as experienced by a listener when certain combinations of tones or notes are sounded together. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant sound (stable).

Before we discuss the names of the notes, remember this important fact: there are only 12 note names. There's something that we need to discuss first before we get into those 12 note names&emdash;The Major Scale.

## Part 2: The Major Scale is a palette of 7 "colors"

The Major Scale is probably the most important scale that you will learn. Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians, over the course of thousands of years, have come to the conclusion that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes.

To find out which notes go onto our palette, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. Here's how to create the "palette":

1. Pick your first noteâ€”how about the 8th fret of the low E string (or 3rd fret of the A string).
2. Move 2 frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move 2 frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move 1 fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move 2 frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move 2 frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move 2 frets and play the 19th fret.
8. And finally, move 1 fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

Definitions to learn: the first note in a scale is called the Tonic.
