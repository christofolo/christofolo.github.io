## Intro: You shouldn't JUST "play by ear". You need some music theory (ie. knowledge)

__This is a work in progress. Please email me with any questions: chrispaul.ws@gmail.com__

Basic music theory is not complicated but most music teachers struggle in getting their guitar students to understand it. I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite-sized pieces. 

It may seem like I explain things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Musical notes are kind of like colors. Some colors go well with other colors. Some clash.

Sometimes, it can be useful to compare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/palette-painting.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*A palette of a few simple colors results in a more complex creation.*

Why is the color "orange" called orange? We've given that color that name. In music, we have also given all the pitches names as well. A "pitch" or sound is what we hear when we play the guitar, or sing a melody, beat a drum, etc. Pitches can be low (dark). Or they can be high (bright). In music, a "note" is a named pitch. When you play just one string on the guitar, you are playing a single note. 

In art, it's perfectly acceptable to consider "dark red" and "light red" both "red". They are just different shades of the same color.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/red.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The same thing happens in music. By now, you may have learned the names of the strings. E, A, D, G, B, and E. Why are two strings called "E" when they're obviously making different pitches? One is really low. The other is really high.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-e-fretboard.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*When you tune your guitar, both of these strings will be an "E". The thinner E string is a higher pitched E. Whereas, the thicker E string is a lower pitched E. They're both named E.*

When you play both of these strings, you'll noticed an interesting phenomenon that happens in music: consonance.

__Consonance__ is the impression of __stability__ and repose while __dissonance__ is the impression of __tension__ or clash as experienced by a listener when certain combinations of tones or notes are sounded together. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant sound (stable). If they don't, it's most likeley that your guitar is not in tune.

The low E is like a dark red. The high E is like a light red.

## Part 2: Every 12 notes, the note name repeats.

Because of the phenomenon, consonance, there are only 12 note names. That means every 12 notes, the name of the note repeats.

Try this on the guitar. Play the low E string. Then play each fret until you get to the 12th fret. Can you guess what the 12th fret will sound like?

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-to-e.png?123abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The note at the 12th fret should sound "like" the open string but just higher. The note at the 12th fret of the E string is also called "E" because it is in perfect consonance with the pitch at the open string—the low E.

Try it with every other string too. The 12th fret of the A string is also an "A".

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The note that is 12 frets higher is an "octave" higher. Without knowing the names of all the notes on the guitar, you can play the note that is an octave higher. For example, play the note on the 3rd fret of the E string. 3 + 12 = 15. Next play the 15th fret of the E string.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3-to-15.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Do you hear how they produce consonance? Did you also notice that the dots on the fretboard can help you find the note in the next octave?

Here is a video of a droning A note. Here's a challenge for you. Without knowing anything about the guitar, can you find the "A" note on the D string? 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpQ6c0NotCY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are still several note names for you to learn. However, we need to next discuss The Major Scale first. 

Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play any note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
3. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade" of the low E string (6th string) on the A string (5th string). Which fret does the higher "E" occur on the A string? Start on the 1st fret of the A string and go higher in pitch until you have found it.


## Part 2: The Major Scale creates a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/solfa.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Solfege Syllables is a way to sing the Major Scale without knowing the names of any notes.*

The Major Scale is probably the most important collection of notes that you will learn. We will use it to make music! Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians have come to the conclusion, over the course of thousands of years, that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes. But there is a specific order... 

To build the Major Scale, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Major Scale formula.*

Here's how to create the "palette" (the Major Scale) on the guitar:

1. Pick your first note. I chose the 8th fret of the low E string.
2. Move __2__ frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move __2__ frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move __1__ fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move __2__ frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move __2__ frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move __2__ frets and play the 19th fret.
8. Move __1__ fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are 7 notes. Remember that the two pitches that are 12 frets apart get the same name.*

You can use the formula anywhere on the guitar. Let's choose the 3rd fret of the low E string as our starting point.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. 3rd fret ("Do"), 5th fret ("Re"), and so on...*

Remember that the note at the 3rd fret is the same note as the 15th fret, just at an octave higher. So if you count the notes that result from the Major Scale pattern, then you will find it creates a "palette" of 7 notes.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?abc?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are only 7 notes. The last note is "1" again but at the higher "octave".*

__This is why there are 7 principle note names: A, B, C, D, E, F, G!__ It's all the Major Scale's fault.


Practice Exercises:

1. Play the Major scale on a single string starting on any fret that you wish.
2. Try using a droning note.

## Part 3: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

If "A" is the first note in the alphabet, shouldn't the first major scale be the A Major Scale? There's a long history as to why C is actually the first note that we create a Major scale from. It's kind of like asking "why is the color 'red' called 'red' at all?" Maybe in another universe the color red is actually called "Der". And maybe the 8th fret of the low E string is an "A". 

But that's not the case in this universe. The 8th fret of the low E string is a "C".

So let's take this diagram:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And label each note with its correct name. Start with C. Go up the alphabet. Once you reach G (the 7th note in the alphabet), loop back around to A. Like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is __actually__ C♮ (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is F♮ or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is G♮ or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after you reach G. This is called the C Major Scale because it starts with C:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. If C is on fret 8, we also know that fret 20 is also "C" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 7 of the low E string? (Hint: 7+12=19) Can you figure out what note is on fret 5? Fret 3? Fret 1?
2. Play the C major scale on the low E string. Say each note as you play it!
3. Play the C major scale on the A string (starting on the 3rd fret). Say each note as you play it!

## Part 4: Building the G Major Scale (intro to "sharps")

If you did Practice Exercise #1 in Part 3, then you discovered that fret 3 is the note "G". 

So let's use the Major Scale formula and mark each fret without naming it just yet. Starting on fret 3 (which we now know is "G"):

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

There is one fret that was not in the C major scale. It is fret 14. Fret 13 is "F♮". Fret 15 is "G♮". So what note is fret 14? It is called F♯ (pronounced "F Sharp").

Here are the 2 rules for building a Major Scale.

1. It must follow the 221-2221 pattern.
2. It must represent each letter of the musical alphabet in its circular order.

Here is a diagram that shows both F♮ and F♯ in context. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*F♮ is the 13th fret. F♯ is the 14th fret. You must use F♯ in the G Major Scale because it will fit in the 221-2221 pattern.*

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is G♮ (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short. 
3. Move __2__—The 7th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
4. Move __1__—The 8th fret is C♮ or just "C" for short.
5. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short.
6. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
7. Move __2__—The 14th fret is F♯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move __1__—The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Part 5: A pitch can have two names (intro to "flats")

The pitch that occurs at the 14th fret (F♯) has another name: G♭ (pronounced "G flat"). Yeah, this is kind of weird. The reason why G♭ is not used in the G Major Scale is because we need to fulfill rule number 2. If you use G♭ instead of F♯, then the scale would skip an "F" entirely. You can't do that. There are some other scales that will use G♭. We will build those later in this book.

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The 6th fret pitch has two names: A♯ and B♭.*

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move 2—The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move 2—The 5th fret is A.
4. Move 1—The 6th fret has two names. A♯ or B♭ (pronounced "B Flat"). The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is B♭.
5. Move 2—The 8th fret is C.
6. Move 2—The 10th fret is D.
7. Move 2—The 12th fret is E.
8. Move 1—The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the G Major scale on the low E string and say each note.
2. Play the F Major scale on the low E string and say each note.

## Part 6: All 12 Notes and Their Names

You can see all 12 notes on the A string. These 12 notes are also on every other string as well. It's just easy to show on one string and not overload you with information.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/chromatic scale.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

__Remember:__ There is a half-step between ALL notes. However, the only two natural note pairs that are a half-step apart are E to F and B to C.

## Part 7: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

The 221-2221 formula can also be called WWH-WWWH. "W" represents a whole step (moving 2 frets). "H" represents a half step (moving just 1 fret).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-with-chromatic.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. We have chosen "C" to be our tonic.
2. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is D. 
3. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is E.
4. Move a __half step__, the next note in the scale is F.
5. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is G.
6. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is A.
7. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is B.
8. Move a __half step__, the final note in the scale is C again.

Because there are so many W's, I like to separate it like this WWH - W - WWH. There are 2 "WWH" pieces and they are "attached" with a "W" piece. Or you can just continue using the 221-2221 formula.

Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 9: The Minor Scale Formula

The Minor Scale Formula is 212-2122. Or WHW-WHWW (W = whole step and H = half step)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-minor-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret of the A string is B. 
3. Move __1__. The 3rd fret is C.
4. Move __2__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __1__. The 8th fret is F.
7. Move __2__. The 10th fret is G.
8. Move __2__. The 12th fret is A again. (Note: the open string is referred to as 0. 0 + 12 frets = 12th fret)

Why is it called minor? To see why it's called minor, we need to compare it to the A Major Scale. You will be able to see the difference when comparing the two.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-major-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move 2. The 2nd fret is B. 
3. Move 2. The 4th fret is C♯. <- here is the first difference between the two scales
4. Move 1. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move 2. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move 2. The 9th fret is F♯.
7. Move 2. The 11th fret is G♯.
8. Move 1. The 12th fret is A again.

| Scale Degree:  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Major Scale  | A  | B  | C♯ | D  | E  | F♯ | G♯ | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __4__  | 5  | 7  | 9  | 11 | 12 |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Minor Scale  | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __3__  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 10 | 12 |


The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is only 3 frets (half steps) apart in a Minor scale. 

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is larger. It is 4 frets (half steps) apart in a Major scale.

In music, the distance between two notes is called an __interval__. The interval that spans 3 notes is called a "Third". For example, A to C♯ is a "Third" and A to C is also a "Third". Both thirds span 3 note names (A, B, and C).

However, if it only takes 3 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next, then it is considered a minor third. If it takes 4 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next, then it is considered a major third.

As you can see above, the interval from A to C♯ is 4 half steps, thus Major. And the interval from A to C is just 3 half steps, thus Minor.

Think of constellations to understand Major vs Minor. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big" (a Major Third). Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small" (a Minor Third).

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale on the open A string and say each note.
2. Play the A Major scale on the open A string and say each note.

## Part 10: Exploring Thirds in the C Major Scale

A Major 3rd is a root tone and a tone __4__ half steps higher. A Minor 3rd is a root tone and a tone __3__ half steps higher. Both Third intervals will span 3 note names (like C to E).

With C as the root, C to E is a Major Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| C  | D♭ | D  | E♭ | E  |

As visualized on the guitar (C Major Scale on the A string starting on the 3rd fret):

With D as the root, D to F is a Minor Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |

| D  | E♭ | E  | F  |

## Part 11: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)

Triad is the most common type of "chord". "Tri" in triad means three. A triad is 2 third intervals put together. For example, C - E - G is called the C Major triad. The root note is C. The C-E third is a Major third. The E-G third is a Minor Third. It is called a Major Triad because the 1st Third is Major (C-E).

D - F - A is called the D Minor triad because the 1st Third is Minor (D-F). The 2nd Third is Major (F-A).

Triads contain both a Major Third and a Minor Third. However, Major triads will have the Major Third come first. In Minor triads, it is the opposite.

An easy way to build all the traids from a scale is to skip every note. C-E-G...D-F-A...and so on.

In root position, the C Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | C    | E   | G   |

In root position, the D Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | D    | F   | A   |

In root position, the E Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | E    | G   | B   |

In root position, the F Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | F    | A   | C   |

In root position, the G Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | G    | B   | D   |

In root position, the A Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | A    | C   | E   |

## Part 12: The Diminished Triad

Major and Minor triads are each composed of a Major third and a Minor third. However, what if you were to create a chord that is composed of two minor thirds? This triad is called a Diminished triad and it happens naturally in every Major scale.

In root position, the B Diminished Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | B    | D   | F   |

B-D is a Minor third. D-F is a Minor third.

## Part 13: Numbering Each Chord - The Nashville Numbering System

We use Roman Numerals to number each chord so that we don't get confused with the chord tone numbers. R = root (or just 1). A big Roman Numeral means that it is a Major chord. A small roman number means that it is a Minor chord. The vii° is the one diminished chord.

| 5 | G | A  | B   | C  | D | E  | F    | 
| 3 | E | F  | G   | A  | B | C  | D    |
| R | C | D  | E   | F  | G | A  | B    |
| - | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |
