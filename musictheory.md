title: Music Theory for Visual Learners
subtitle: The basic knowledge of how music works
---

Many guitarists will start noodling around on their instrument after learning how to play several chords and riffs. This is a lot of fun to do. However, the real magic happens when you can improvise with other musicians. This is what separates the visual arts from music - creative collaboration. It is so much more fun to play with other musicians.

Basic music theory will give you the tools to understand how to fit your melodies over your bandmate's harmonies. Or, vice versa, it will show you how to create harmonies that fit with your bandmate's melodies.

If you're not in a band yet, you will learn how to improvise guitar riffs and melodies over any of your favorite songs.

But let's start simple. 

## Part 1: Why are two strings on the guitar both "E"?

Here are the names of the strings. I'm sure by now you have seen an image like this.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

How can two strings get the same name? The two E strings on the guitar obviously produce very different pitches. One is really high. One is really low. These two pitches are a lot like two shades of the same color. For example, dark red and light red are both considered red. It's the same thing with music.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/red.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

When you play both of the E strings at the same time you'll notice that they sound alike. They sound like they "just fit" together. This phenomenon is generally called consonance. And in this particular case, it is perfect consonance.

__Consonance__ is the impression of __stability__ while __dissonance__ is the impression of __tension__ or clash. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant, stable sound. If they don't, it's most likely that your guitar is not in tune.

Go to <a href="https://szynalski.com/tone#E2,squ,v0.75">https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator</a>. The frequency should already be set at 82.4 Hz.

Next, click the x2 button to double the frequency of the pitch. Do you notice what happens to the name of the tone? Then click the x1/2 button to halve the frequency. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/frequency-2x-or-half.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What is the frequency relationship between the pitches at E2 and E3? What about E4? E5? And so on...

__Definition of "note"__: A note is a named pitch. When you hear the sound produced by an instrument, that is a pitch. We've given names to these pitches by using letters of the alphabet. 

## Part 2: Consonance in music means there are only 12 note names

You'll continue to notice this effect of consonance when you play any of the open strings and then play the 12th fret of that same string. The pitch at the 12th fret is in perfect consonance with the pitch of that same open string. 

The 12th fret, therefore, gets the same note name. However, it is a note that is an __octave__ higher. 

Did you try out the tone generator? A pitch that has twice the frequency of another is exactly one octave higher. A pitch that has half the frequency of another is one octave lower. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Without knowing the names of all the notes on the guitar, you can play the note that is an octave higher. For example, play the note on the 3rd fret of the E string. 3 + 12 = 15. So next play the 15th fret of the E string. Notice that the note at the 15th fret sounds like a lighter shade of the note at the 3rd fret. When you learn the name of the note at the 3rd fret, you will also know the name of the note that is 12 frets higher at the 15th fret.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3-to-15.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The dots above the 12th fret help you know what you are playing. They are the same notes but just an octave higher. For example, the first dot above the 12th fret (15th fret) has the same note name as the 3rd fret.*

__The important thing to understand:__ If notes repeat every 12 frets, that means there are only 12 note names in total. 

Before we get into those note names, we need to next discuss The Major Scale first. It will reveal why we only use 7 letters of the alphabet instead of 12.

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" (the octave higher) at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play __any__ note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
3. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade" (the octave higher) of the low E string (6th string) on the A string (5th string). Which fret does the higher "E" occur on the A string? Start on the 1st fret of the A string and go higher in pitch until you have found it.
4. Play each of the 12 notes on the low E string

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/chromatic-e-to-e.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The frets are on the line. The left hand fingerings are below. Notice that once you reach the 5th fret, you start playing with the 1st finger again.*


## Part 3: The Major Scale creates a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/solfa.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Solfege Syllables*

Basically, all of the music you have ever heard in your life is largely based on just seven notes.

The Major Scale is probably the most important collection of notes that you will learn. We will use the Major Scale to make music! It originated with monks and nuns as early as the 8th century sung who sung "plain chant" (also known as gregorian chant). It is one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song and it only requires 7 notes. But there is a specific order... 

To build the Major Scale, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Major Scale formula.*

Here's how to create the "palette" (the Major Scale) on the guitar:

1. Pick your first note. I chose the 8th fret of the low E string.
2. Move __2__ frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move __2__ frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move __1__ fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move __2__ frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move __2__ frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move __2__ frets and play the 19th fret.
8. Move __1__ fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are 7 notes. Remember that the two pitches that are 12 frets apart get the same name.*

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?abc?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are only 7 notes. The last note is "1" again but at the higher "octave".*

Because most music revolves around just 7 notes (the Major Scale), we only use 7 letters of the alphabet for the basis of naming all the pitches. We would run out of letters if we gave every pitch a unique name.

__Important Definition:__ The first note of the Major Scale has a general descriptor called the "Tonic". 

#### Practice Exercise

1. Play the Major scale against the backing track below (starting on the 8th fret). Start on the 8th fret of the low E string and follow the formula 221-2221. As you play each note, take a moment and listen to how each note feels. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MimVnBAuYqA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Part 4: All Major Scales Sound the Same because Music is Relative

Music is relative. Try this out and listen carefully.

You can use the Major Scale formula anywhere on the guitar. Let's choose the 3rd fret of the low E string as our starting point.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. 3rd fret ("1"), 5th fret ("2"), 7th fret ("3") and so on...*

Because we use the same formula, we start counting from "1" until we reach "7" and then once you get to the 15th fret, you're back at "1" again. Remember that the note at the 3rd fret has the same note name as the 15th fret, just at an octave higher. So if you count the notes that result from the Major Scale pattern, then you will find it creates a "palette" of 7 notes.

#### Practice Exercise

1. Play the Major scale starting on the 3rd fret against the backing track below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvXXdGhJA1Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


## Part 5: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

If "A" is the first note in the alphabet, shouldn't the first major scale be the A Major Scale? There's a long history as to why C is actually the first note in the musical alphabet. It's kind of like asking "why are the 3 primary colors red, yellow, and blue?" Maybe in another universe the 3 primary colors are Orange, Green, and Violet. And maybe the first note in their musical alphabet is "A". 

But that's not the case in this universe. The 8th fret of the low E string produces a pitch at 130 Hz. As a society we have given this pitch the name of "C". 

So let's take this diagram:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And label each note with its correct name. Start with C. Go up the alphabet. Once you reach G (the 7th note in the alphabet), loop back around to A. Like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is __actually__ Câ™® (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is Dâ™® or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is Eâ™® or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is Fâ™® or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is Gâ™® or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is Aâ™® or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is Bâ™® or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after you reach G. This is called the C Major Scale because it starts with C:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Because we are forced to follow the major scale pattern (221-2221), some note names are right next to each other and some are a fret apart. 

#### Practice

1. If C is on fret 8, we also know that fret 20 is also "C" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 7 of the low E string? (Hint: 7+12=19) Can you figure out what note is on fret 5? Fret 3? Fret 1?

## Part 6: The A String

If you did the exercise in part 5, you should have been able to figure out what the note names are for frets 7, 5, 3, and 1 of the low E string. Here are the answers:

<center>Fret 1 is F. Fret 3 is G. Fret 5 is A. Fret 7 is B.</center>

You may have noticed that you have an "A" string and that fret 5 of the low E string is also "A". Have you also noticed that they produce the same pitch? (Try playing the open A string and the 5th fret of the E string at the same time.)

<center>Well, they do!</center>

If B is two frets higher than A, then what does that tell us about the A string? What is fret 2 of the A string?

__Answer:__ it is B. If C is the very next note above B, then what does that tell us about the 3rd fret of the A string?

__Answer:__ it is the note C.

If C is on the 3rd fret of the A string, could you also play the C Major scale on the A string using the same Major scale pattern of 221-2221?

__Answer:__ Yes!

<center>Ok, give it a try!</center>

Here is the tab for you to follow:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-tab.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Scale degrees are above the staff. The numbers on the 5th line are the frets that you should play on the A string.*

## Part 7: Building the G Major Scale (intro to "sharps")

If you did the various Practice Exercises in the previous sections, then you discovered that fret 3 is the note "G". 

So let's use the Major Scale formula and mark each fret without naming it just yet. Starting on fret 3 (which we now know is "G"):

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Once you reach the 8th fret, you'll notice that it is similar to the C Major Scale (frets 8, 10, and 12 are C, D, and E respectively). However, it deviates once you get to fret 14. In the C Major Scale, fret 13 is "Fâ™®" and fret 15 is "Gâ™®". So what note is fret 14? It is called Fâ™¯ (pronounced "F Sharp").

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Fâ™® is the 13th fret. Fâ™¯ is the 14th fret. You must use Fâ™¯ in the G Major Scale because of the 2 Major Scale Rules.*

Here are the 2 rules for building a Major Scale.

1. It must follow the 221-2221 pattern.
2. It must represent each letter of the musical alphabet in its circular order.

Build the G Major Scale:

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is Gâ™® (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move __2__â€”The 5th fret is Aâ™® or just "A" for short. 
3. Move __2__â€”The 7th fret is Bâ™® or just "B" for short.
4. Move __1__â€”The 8th fret is Câ™® or just "C" for short.
5. Move __2__â€”The 10th fret is Dâ™® or just "D" for short.
6. Move __2__â€”The 12th fret is Eâ™® or just "E" for short.
7. Move __2__â€”The 14th fret is Fâ™¯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move __1__â€”The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Practice Exercises:

1. If G is on fret 3, we also know that fret 15 is also "G" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 2 of the low E string?
2. Since we've learned that some of the notes on the low E string, can be played on the A string, try playing the G Major scale like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-e-a-strings-tab.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Scale degrees are above the staff. The first 3 notes are played on the low E string. But the rest are played on the A string.*

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvXXdGhJA1Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Part 8: A pitch can have two names (intro to "flats")

The pitch that occurs at the low E string's 14th fret (Fâ™¯) has another name: Gâ™­ (pronounced "G flat"). Yeah, this is kind of weird. The reason why Gâ™­ is not used in the G Major Scale is because we need to fulfill rule number 2 (from Part 7). If you use Gâ™­ instead of Fâ™¯, then the scale would skip an "F" entirely. 

This is wrong: G, A, B, C, D, E, Gâ™­, G. 

You can't do that. You have to include each letter. 

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat note. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The 6th fret pitch has two names: Aâ™¯ and Bâ™­. If your scale already uses an A, then you must use Bâ™­.*

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move __2__â€”The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move __2__â€”The 5th fret is A.
4. Move __1__â€”The 6th fret has two names. Aâ™¯ or Bâ™­. The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is Bâ™­.
5. Move __2__â€”The 8th fret is C.
6. Move __2__â€”The 10th fret is D.
7. Move __2__â€”The 12th fret is E.
8. Move __1__â€”The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the F Major scale on the low E string against this backing track:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC4DzsV4ivs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Part 9: Playing Scales Across the E, A, and D Strings

The hard part about playing scales on a single string is that you are constantly shifting your left hand around the neck. The reason why I teach this way is to help you visualize the logic of notes that are higher in pitch get closer to the bridge/right hand/sound hole. When you want to play notes that go lower in pitch, you move towards the nut/head stock.

However, the guitar is a matrix. It has 6 strings. And therefore we can simplify our playing a little bit by staying in a single position. Let's play the G Major and F Major scales in a single position like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-position-3.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The left hand fingerings are below the staff. Use fingers 1, 2, and 4.*

#### Practice Exercises:

1. If F is 2 frets lower than G, then that means the entire F Major Scale is shifted 2 frets towards the nut. Are you able to figure out how to play the F Major Scale across the 3 lower strings without me showing you the tab?


## Part 10: All 12 Notes and Their Names. The Chromatic Scale

From C to C, here are the names of all 12 notes. Underneath each note, you'll see the fret number of the low E string. There are two rows because each flat/sharp note has two names.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/all12notes.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here is C to C on the A string. I have labeled the fret numbers under each note.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-on-a-string.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

__Remember:__ There is a half-step between ALL notes. However, the only two natural note pairs that are a half-step apart are E to F and B to C.

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the chromatic scale in position 1 across all 6 strings.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/chromatic-tab.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The left hand finger is below the staff. Use your pinky to play frets 4 and 5.*

## Part 11: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

The 221-2221 formula can also be called WWH-WWWH. "W" represents a whole step (moving 2 frets). "H" represents a half step (moving just 1 fret).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-with-chromatic.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. We have chosen "C" to be our tonic.
2. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is D. 
3. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is E.
4. Move a __half step__, the next note in the scale is F.
5. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is G.
6. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is A.
7. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is B.
8. Move a __half step__, the final note in the scale is C again.

Because there are so many W's, I like to separate it like this WWH - W - WWH. There are 2 "WWH" pieces and they are "attached" with a "W" piece. Or you can just continue using the 221-2221 formula.



#### Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 12: The Minor Scale "Formula"

Some people teach that the Minor Scale Formula has its own formula (212-2122). But since we have already learned how to play the Major Scale, the secret to playing a Minor Scale is to start on the 6th degree. Let's review the C Major Scale on just one string. Here is the tab:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-tab.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The Minor Scale is comprised of the same notes but starting on the 6th degree - in this case the note "A". Thus it is called the A Minor scale. It looks like this:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-minor-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And the tab:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-minor-scale-tab.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The scale degrees are above the staff. Minor Scales start on the 6th scale degree.*

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale against the A droning track below.

## Part 13: Introduction to Intervals - Why is the Major Scale called "major" and why is the Minor Scale "minor"?

Why are "Major Scales" considered Major and why are "Minor Scales" considered Minor? The answer lies in the distance between the Tonic and the 3rd note.

In a Major scale, the "distance" from the Tonic to the third note is 4 half-steps. In music, the distance between two notes is called an __interval__.

| Half steps traversed from C to E: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | C  | Dâ™­ | D  | Eâ™­ | E  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Scale Degree: | 1  |  | 2  |   | 3  |

In a Minor scale, the distance from the Tonic to the third note is just 3 half-steps.

| Half steps traversed from A to C: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | A  | Bâ™­ | B  | C |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Scale Degree: | 6  |  | 7  | 1 |

The interval that spans 3 notes is called a "Third". For example, C to E is a "Third" and A to C is also a "Third". Both thirds span 3 note names.

However, if it only takes 3 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a minor third (A to C). If it takes 4 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a major third (C to E).

As you can see above, the distance from C to E is 4 half steps, thus Major. And the distance from A to C is just 3 half steps, which is smaller, and thus Minor.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ursa.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Think of constellations to understand the Major and Minor designations. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big" (a Major Third). Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small" (a Minor Third).

## Part 14: Exploring Thirds in the C Major Scale

A Major 3rd is a root tone and a tone __4__ half steps higher. A Minor 3rd is a root tone and a tone __3__ half steps higher. Both Third intervals will span 3 note names (like C to E).

Here are all Third Intervals in the C Major scale.

| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 3rd:  |  E |  F |  G |  A |  B |  C |  D |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Root:  |  C |  D |  E |  F |  G |  A |  B |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

But which ones are Major and which ones are Minor? Let's explore...

With C as the root, C to E is a Major Third:

| Half steps traversed: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | C  | Dâ™­ | D  | Eâ™­ | E  |

As visualized on the guitar on both the low E string and the A string:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-to-e-intervals-on-a-e.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

With D as the root, D to F is a Minor Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| D  | Eâ™­ | E  | F  |

As visualized on the guitar on both the low E string and the A string:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/d-to-f-intervals-on-a-e.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

With E as the root, E to G is a Minor Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| E  | F  | Gâ™­ | G  |

As visualized on the guitar on both the low E string and the A string:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-to-g-intervals-on-a-e.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

With F as the root, F to A is a Major Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| F  | Gâ™­ | G  | Aâ™­ | A  |

## Part 15: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)

Triad is the most common type of "chord". "Tri" in triad means three. A triad is 2 third intervals put together. For example, C - E - G is called the C Major triad. The root note is C. The C-E third is a Major third. The E-G third is a Minor Third. It is called a Major Triad because the 1st Third is Major (C-E).

D - F - A is called the D Minor triad because the 1st Third is Minor (D-F). The 2nd Third is Major (F-A).

Triads contain both a Major Third and a Minor Third. However, Major triads will have the Major Third come first. In Minor triads, it is the opposite.

An easy way to build all the traids from a scale is to skip every other note in the scale. C-E-G...D-F-A...and so on.

The C Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | C    | E   | G   |

The D Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | D    | F   | A   |

The E Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | E    | G   | B   |

The F Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | F    | A   | C   |

The G Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | G    | B   | D   |

The A Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | A    | C   | E   |

### The Perfect 5th

All Major and minor triads contain a perfect 5th interval from the root note to the 5th. A perfect 5th is defined as spanning 5 note names and traversing 7 half steps. Here are two quick examples that show the distance from C to G and from D to A.

| Half steps traversed: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | C | Dâ™­  | D | Eâ™­  | E | F | Gâ™­ | G |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | D | Eâ™­  | E | F | Gâ™­ | G | Aâ™­ | A |


__Important thing to understand:__ Triads contain BOTH Major and Minor third intervals. The thing that distinguishes Major triads from Minor traids is how they are built.

## Part 16: The Diminished Triad

Major and Minor triads are each composed of a Major third and a Minor third. However, what if you were to create a chord that is composed of two minor thirds? This triad is called a Diminished triad and it happens naturally in every Major scale.

The B Diminished Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | B    | D   | F   |

B-D is a Minor third. D-F is a Minor third.

The interval from the root note to the 5th is called a diminished 5th because only 6 half steps are traversed.

| Half steps traversed: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 | 6 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | B  | C | Dâ™­  | D | Eâ™­  | E | F |

Remember: a perfect 5th interval is 7 half steps apart.

## Part 17: Numbering Each Chord - The Nashville Numbering System

All 7 triads in the key of C. R = root tone of the chord. 3 = the "third" of the chord. 5 = the "5th" of the chord. Because C is the first note in the scale, its chord is called the "one" chord but use roman numerals because we want to distinguish these numbers from the chord tone numbers.

| 5 | G | A  | B   | C  | D | E  | F    | 
| 3 | E | F  | G   | A  | B | C  | D    |
| R | C | D  | E   | F  | G | A  | B    |
| - | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | viiÂ° |

A big Roman Numeral means that it is a Major chord. A small roman number means that it is a Minor chord. The viiÂ° is the diminished chord.

In part 10, we found that there are 3 Major third dyads (sometimes call "double stops") in a Major key: C-E, F-A, and G-B. We also found that there are 4 Minor third dyads (D-F, E-G, A-C, B-D).

In parts 11 and 12, we then constructed the appropriate triad from each scale degree. We determined that chords built off of C, F, and G are Major. Chords built off of D, E, and A are Minor. And the chord built off of the B is diminished.

__Important thing to understand:__ A Major key produces chords that are Major, Minor, and diminished. It's called a Major key because the first chord is Major.

## Part 18: Improvisation for Beginners. Applying Theory to Make Music.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/stepping-stones.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

There are a few ways to cross the river. You don't have to use any of the stepping stones. Let's assume that the river isn't that deep. You could just wade through the water. But just know that you will get wet. 

Maybe you'll try your best to use the stones but sometimes you will slip off. You only get a little wet.

And finally, you could cross the river by stepping on the stones and never getting wet at all.

When I began learning how to improvise, I was told to play whatever I felt like. After the end of my solo, it seem liked I just fell in the river. It honestly wasn't very fun. I didn't really know what I was doing. I was told: "Here's a scale. Just use the notes in the scale!"

Later, my teachers told me about the stepping stones. In music, they are called "chord tones". I knew they were there. But I just didn't quite understand how to use them in my solos. Chord tones are the individual notes that make up a chord. Instead of "playing whatever you want" and getting "soaking wet", you should begin to understand how to rely on chord tones. It's a logical method because it provides a straightforward path for you to follow. You will be improvising which path to take. And the more you get comfortable with the paths you take, you can begin to get your feet wet with using other tools (like notes from scales).

#### How to stay "dry" when improvising a melody (ie. soloing)

Songs are made up of harmonies (chords) and melodies (vocals and/or instrumental solos). Here is a common chord progression in the key of C that is similar to Let It Be by The Beatles

C - G - Am - F.

Here are the chord tones for each chord:

| 5 | G | D  | E  | C  |
| 3 | E | B  | C  | A  |
| R | C | G  | A  | F  |
| - | I | V  | vi | IV |

The next step is to visually see where these chord tones are in the C Major scale. I will put 4 columns of the C Major scale and highlight each chord within the scale. The numbers on the left are the scale degree.

| 7 | B | __B__  | B  | B  |
| 6 | A | A  | __A__  | __A__  |
| 5 | __G__ | __G__  | G  | G  |
| 4 | F | F  | F  | __F__  |
| 3 | __E__ | E  | __E__  | E  |
| 2 | D | __D__  | D  | D  |
| 1 | __C__ | C  | __C__  | __C__  |
| - | I (C) | V (G) | vi (Am) | IV (F) |
