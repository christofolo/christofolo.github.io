title: Music Theory for Visual Learners
subtitle: The basic knowledge of how music works
---

Basic music theory is not complicated or hard to understand. It should actually be called music knowledge because you will learn how music works. You should learn music theory because it will give you the base understanding that you need to: 1) play songs/improvise with other musicians; 2) modify or improve other musicians' songs; and 3) create your own songs.

There are a lot of patterns in Music theory. Once you understand the fundamental patterns, everything will make sense. However, because everything in music is connected, it can be difficult to grasp even just the basics. Sometimes it seems like that you have to learn music theory all at once. However, I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite sized pieces. 

It may seem like I do things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Notes are like colors

Sometimes, it can be useful to compare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting.

Artists can mix paints to create new colors. Musicians can do the same thing by playing multiple notes at the same time. When musicians make music with single notes, that is often called "melody". When musicans combine notes and play them at the same time, that is often called "harmony". Most beginners start with learning how to play harmony with common open-position chords like G major, D major, C major, etc.

Like colors, each pitch that is produced by an instrument has a name. However, some colors are called "dark" or "light" depending on their brightness. The colors "dark red" and "light red" are both red. The same thing happens in music. You can hear this interesting phenomenon on the guitar when you play each note on the A string.

If you play each and every fret on the A string, you'll noticet that the note on the 12th fret "just fits" with the note played at the open string. This is why we call the note at the 12th fret "A" as well. It is NOT the same note...it just has the same name.

You can also hear this phenomone when you play the 1st string (the one closest to your toes) and the 6th string (the on closest to your nose) at the same time. Both of these strings produce an "E". They should sound like they "fit". If the harmony is slightly "off", then perhaps when of your strings needs to be tuned!

Before we discuss the names of the notes, remember this important fact: there are only 12 note names. There's something that we need to discuss first before we get into those 12 note names&emdash;The Major Scale.

## Part 2: The Major Scale is a palette of 7 "colors"

The Major Scale is probably the most important scale that you will learn. Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians, over the course of thousands of years, have come to the conclusion that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes.

To find out which notes go onto our palette, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. Here's how to create the "palette":

1. Pick your first noteâ€”how about the 8th fret of the low E string (or 3rd fret of the A string).
2. Move 2 frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move 2 frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move 1 fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move 2 frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move 2 frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move 2 frets and play the 19th fret.
8. And finally, move 1 fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale.
