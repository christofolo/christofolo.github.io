## Intro: You shouldn't JUST "play by ear". You need some music theory (ie. knowledge)

Basic music theory is not complicated. Most music teachers struggle in getting their guitar students to understand it, however. Once you understand the fundamental patterns, everything will make sense because everything in music is connected. I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite-sized pieces. 

It may seem like I explain things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Musical notes are kind of like colors

Sometimes, it can be useful to compare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/palette-painting.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*A palette of a few simple colors results in a more complex creation.*

Some of the colors in music can be called notes. Notes are named pitches. Pitches can be high (bright). Or pitches can be low (dark). In art, dark red and light red are both red, just different shades.

"Melody" is like making art without mixing the paints. In music, the melody is made up of notes played or sung in an order that the musican feels "paints" a pleasing picture. When you sing along with a song, you're singing the melody.

Give it a try on your guitar: play one note at a time on your high E string (the string closest to your toes). You can start on the open string, then play up the fretboard on each fret (as high as you'd like!) and then come back down and finish on the open high E string. This is technically a melody but not that interesting.

However, some of the colors in music can be called chords. Artists also mix paints to create new colors. Musicians can do the same thing by playing multiple notes at the same time. The general term for this is "harmony" (at least 2 notes played at the same time). Chords are the most common type of harmony. Generally chords are a minimum of 3 notes played at the same time.

Most beginners start with learning how to play harmony with common open-position chords like E minor. Here is the E minor shape that you can strum:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-minor-shape.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The E minor open position chord*

As you're playing up and down the E string, did you notice something about the open string pitch and the pitch at the 12th fret? The pitch at the 12th fret has the same name as the open string. It's just a "lighter shade":

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-to-a2.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The darker red arrow is pointing to the A string. The brighter red arrow is pointing to the A on the 12th fret.*

If you play each and every fret on the A string, you'll notice that when you reach the 12th fret, this note "just fits" with the first note played at the open string (the A string). Try playing the open string A or the 12th fret (of the A string) while this Cello is "droning" on their "A".

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpQ6c0NotCY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is why we call BOTH notes an "A" (the open 5th string and the note at the 12th fret). No, it is NOT the same note...it just has the same name. One "A" is higher in pitch than the other "A". The lower A and the higher A "just fit" together when played at the same time. This is called "consonance".

You can also hear this phenomenon when you play the 1st string (the one closest to your toes) and the 6th string (the one closest to your nose) at the same time. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-e-fretboard.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*When you tune your guitar, both of these strings will be an "E". The thinner E string is a higher pitched E. Whereas, the thicker E string is a lower pitched E. They're both named E.*

Both of these strings produce an "E". They should sound like they "fit". If the harmony made from playing these two notes sound slightly "off", then perhaps one of your strings needs to be tuned!

Definitions to learn: consonance is the impression of stability and repose while dissonance is the impression of tension or clash as experienced by a listener when certain combinations of tones or notes are sounded together. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant sound (stable).

Before we discuss the names of the notes, remember this important fact: there are only 12 note names. There's something that we need to discuss first before I list all 12 note names—The Major Scale.

Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play any note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
3. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade" of the low E string (6th string) on the A string (5th string). Which fret does the higher "E" occur on the A string? Start on the 1st fret of the A string and go higher in pitch until you have found it.

Important thing to know: There are only 12 notes. Their names will repeat. You can see and hear this on the guitar. The 1st fret and the 13th fret on a string will have the same note name.

## Part 2: The Major Scale creates a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/solfa.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Solfege Syllables is a way to sing the Major Scale without knowing the names of any notes.*

The Major Scale is probably the most important collection of notes that you will learn. We will use it to make music! Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians have come to the conclusion, over the course of thousands of years, that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes. But there is a specific order... 

To build the Major Scale, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Major Scale formula.*

Here's how to create the "palette" (the Major Scale) on the guitar:

1. Pick your first note. I chose the 8th fret of the low E string.
2. Move __2__ frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move __2__ frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move __1__ fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move __2__ frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move __2__ frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move __2__ frets and play the 19th fret.
8. Move __1__ fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. If you sing, then say the solfege syllables. 8th fret ("Do"), 10th fret ("Re"), and so on... Sing "Do" for the 1st note and the last note because they are 12 frets apart.*

You can use the formula anywhere on the guitar. Let's choose the 3rd fret of the low E string as our starting point.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. 3rd fret ("Do"), 5th fret ("Re"), and so on...*

Definitions to learn: the first note in a scale is called the Tonic. 

In music theory, you can also number the notes in the Major Scale. Instead of using the Solfege syllables ("Do", "Re", etc), just use "1", "2", and so on...

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?abc?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are only 7 notes. The last note is "1" again but at the higher "octave".*

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the Major scale on a single string starting on any fret that you wish.
2. Try using a droning note.

## Part 3: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is C♮ (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is F♮ or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is G♮ or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after the G. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Why are E and F right next to each other? And why are B and C right next to each other?

It's because of the Major Scale formula. Remember 221-2221? Let me show you on the fretboard again:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*This is the C Major Scale without labeling the note names*

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*This is the C Major Scale with the notes names labeled.*

Why is the 8th fret the note "C"? Well, it could have been named anything. Why is the color orange named "orange"? It could have been named anything. Over thousands of years, musicians have come to the conclusion that the pitch that occurs at the 8th fret of the E string is "C". 

If there are only 7 notes in the Major Scale, we will only use 7 letters of the alphabet (A through G). This is why the C Major Scale loops back around after the note G. And because the Major Scale MUST follow the 221-2221 pattern, that means some notes will be two frets apart (C-D, D-E, F-G, G-A, A-B) and some other notes will just be 1 fret apart (E-F and B-C). 

Practice Exercises:

1. If C is on fret 8, we also know that fret 20 is also "C" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 7? (Hint: 7+12=19) Can you figure out what note is on fret 5? Fret 3? Fret 1?
2. Play the C major scale on the low E string. Say each note as you play it!
3. Play the C major scale on the A string (starting on the 3rd fret). Say each note as you play it!

## Part 4: Building the G Major Scale (intro to "sharps")

If you did Practice Exercise #1 in Part 3, then you discovered that fret 3 is the note "G". You should have also figured out the notes for frets 5 and 7. Here are the notes from G to G on the low E string:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-mixo.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

So is the G Major Scale? (G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G) It's close but it's not correct. Here are the 2 rules for building a Major Scale.

1. It must follow the 221-2221 pattern.
2. It must represent each letter of the musical alphabet.

Certainly each letter of the musical alphabet is there. But let's number the frets correctly to see it follows the 221-2221 pattern.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-mixo-numbered.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G does not follow the Major Scale Pattern. It is 221-2212. The note on the 13th fret (F) breaks the pattern.*

As you can see, we need to use the note on the 14th fret instead of the 13th fret. That would fix the pattern. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

But what is that note called? Remember that the full name for "F" is actually F♮ (pronounced "F Natural"). The note at the 14th fret is called F♯ (pronounced "F Sharp"). We have now resolved the 2 rules if we use F♯ instead of F♮. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*F♮ is the 13th fret. F♯ is the 14th fret. You must use F♯ in the G Major Scale because it will fit in the 221-2221 pattern.*

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is G♮ (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short. 
3. Move __2__—The 7th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
4. Move __1__—The 8th fret is C♮ or just "C" for short.
5. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short.
6. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
7. Move __2__—The 14th fret is F♯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move __1__—The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Part 5: A pitch can have two names (intro to "flats")

The pitch that occurs at the 14th fret (F♯) has another name: G♭ (pronounced "G flat"). Yeah, this is kind of weird. The reason why G♭ is not used in the G Major Scale is because we need to fulfill rule number 2. If you use G♭ instead of F♯, then the scale would skip an "F" entirely. You can't do that. There are some other scales that will use G♭. We will build those later in this book.

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The 6th fret pitch has two names: A♯ and B♭.*

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move 2—The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move 2—The 5th fret is A.
4. Move 1—The 6th fret has two names. A♯ or B♭ (pronounced "B Flat"). The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is B♭.
5. Move 2—The 8th fret is C.
6. Move 2—The 10th fret is D.
7. Move 2—The 12th fret is E.
8. Move 1—The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the G Major scale on the low E string and say each note.
2. Play the F Major scale on the low E string and say each note.

## Part 6: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

The 221-2221 formula can also be called WWH-WWWH. W represents a whole step. H represents a half step.

Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 7: The Minor Scale Formula

The Minor Scale Formula is 212-2122. Or WHW-WHWW (W = whole step and H = half step)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-a-minor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret of the A string is B. 
3. Move __1__. The 3rd fret is C.
4. Move __2__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __1__. The 8th fret is F.
7. Move __2__. The 10th fret is G.
8. Move __2__. The 12th fret is A again. (Note: the open string is referred to as 0. 0 + 12 frets = 12th fret)

Why is it called minor? To see why it's called minor, we need to compare it to the A Major Scale. You will be able to see the difference when comparing the two.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-a-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move 2. The 2nd fret is B. 
3. Move 2. The 4th fret is C♯. <- here is the first difference between the two scales
4. Move 1. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move 2. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move 2. The 9th fret is F♯.
7. Move 2. The 11th fret is G♯.
8. Move 1. The 12th fret is A again.

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is only 3 frets (or 3 half-steps) in a Minor scale.

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is 4 frets (or 4 half-steps) in a Major scale.

Think of constellations to understand Major vs Minor. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big". Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small".

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale on the open A string and say each note.
2. Play the A Major scale on the open A string and say each note.

## Part 7: Playing the C Major Scale on the A String

Did you notice that the A Minor scale shares many of the same notes of the C Major scale. Once you get to the 3rd note of the A Minor scale (C), the next 5 notes make up much of the C Major Scale (C, D, E, F, G). That means we can play the C Major Scale on the A string if we just continue farther up the fretboard like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-on-a-string.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. Play "C" on the 3rd fret of the A string.
2. Move __2__ frets, play D. 
3. Move __2__ frets, play E.
4. Move __1__ fret, play F.
5. Move __2__ frets, play G.
6. Move __2__ frets, play A (the 12th fret of the A string).
7. Move __2__ frets, play B.
8. Move __1__ fret, play C again.

Or you can play it on both the E string and the A string like this:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-on-e-and-a-strings.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. Play "C" on the 8th fret of the E string.
2. Move __a whole step__, play D. 
3. Move __a whole step__, play E.
4. Move __a half step__, play F on the 8th fret of the A string.
5. Move __a whole step__, play G.
6. Move __a whole step__, play A (the 12th fret of the A string).
7. Move __a whole step__, play B.
8. Move __a half step__, play C again.

## Part 8: The Two Ways to Count In Music Theory

Up until this point, we have been counting like a Computer Scientist—by starting from 0. When you use the Major Scale formula, the first note starts at position "0". Then you start counting the frets or half-steps from there. 

Here are all the notes on the low E string up to the 12th fret. 0 is the open E string. 

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| E  | F  | F♯ | G  | G♯ | A  | A♯ | B  | C  | C♯ | D  | D♯ | E  |

How many half-steps apart is E from B?

The answer is 7. Start from 0, then count. Luckily the fret numbers match the counting system that you should use.

However, if I were to ask you how many half-steps apart is G from D? You need to pretend that G is at 0. Then continue with 1 on G♯, 2 on A and so on... The answer is 7.

Let's do the same exercise but use Flats instead of Sharps.

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| E  | F  | G♭ | G  | A♭ | A  | B♭ | B  | C  | D♭ | D  | E♭ | E  |

How many half-steps is C from F? 

The answer is 7.

When counting notes, always start from 1. For example, what is the 5th note above A? It is E because you start counting on 1 and A is 1 (in this example).

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | A |

In music, we say "E is a 5th above A."

What is the 3rd note above G? It is B because G is 1 in this example.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| G | A | B | C | D | E | F | G |

B is a third above G.

## Part 9: Major Thirds vs. Minor Thirds (Dyads)

We've learned that scales can be Major or Minor. So can intervals. In the example, above I said that "B" is a third above G. But more accurately I should have said B♮ is a Major 3rd from G. There is another note with "B" in its name: B♭. It also is a 3rd above G but you only need to traverse 3 half-steps to get to B♭. Look at the G string on the fret board. B♮ is on the 4th fret. B♭ is on the 3rd fret.


| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| G  | A♭ | A  | B♭ | B♮ |

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - | - | - |
| G | A | B |

Major Third = Spans 3 notes and traverses 4 half-steps.
Minor Third = Spans 3 notes and traverses 3 half-steps.

G to B is a Major Third because the interval spans 3 note names and is 4 half-steps apart.
G to B♭ is a Minor Third because the interval spans 3 notes names is 3 half-steps apart.

Play a G major barre chord. Your 2nd finger plays the B. Take your 2nd finger off to play the G Minor barre chord. Now, your barred finger is playing the B♭ on the 3rd fret.

Definition to know: a dyad is a harmony composed of just two notes.

Definition to know: the "root" is the base note in the harmony. In the examples above, G is the "root" and B or B♭ is the "third".

## Part 9: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)
