title: Music Theory for Visual Learners
subtitle: The basic knowledge of how music works
---

Basic music theory is not complicated or hard to understand. It should actually be called music knowledge because you will learn how music works. You should learn music theory because it will give you the base understanding that you need to: 1) play songs/improvise with other musicians; 2) modify or improve other musicians' songs; and 3) create your own songs.

There are a lot of patterns in Music theory. Once you understand the fundamental patterns, everything will make sense. However, because everything in music is connected, it can be difficult to grasp even just the basics. Sometimes it seems like that you have to learn music theory all at once. However, I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite sized pieces. 

It may seem like I do things a little differently that other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


Part 1: Notes are like colors

Sometimes, it can be useful to cmopare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting.
