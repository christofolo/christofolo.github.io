## Intro: You shouldn't JUST "play by ear". You need some music theory (ie. knowledge)

__This is a work in progress. Please email me with any questions: chrispaul.ws@gmail.com__

Basic music theory is not complicated but most music teachers struggle in getting their guitar students to understand it. I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite-sized pieces. 

It may seem like I explain things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Why are two strings on the guitar both "E"?

Here are the names of the strings. I'm sure by now you have seen an image like this.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

How can two strings get the same name? The two E strings on the guitar obviously produce very different pitches. One is really high. One is really low. These two pitches are a lot like two shades of the same color. For example, dark red and light red are both considered red. It's the same thing with music.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/red.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

When you play both of the E strings at the same time you'll notice that they sound alike. They sound like they "just fit" together. This phenomenon is generally called consonance. And in this particular case, it is perfect consonance.

__Consonance__ is the impression of __stability__ and repose while __dissonance__ is the impression of __tension__ or clash. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant, stable sound. If they don't, it's most likely that your guitar is not in tune.

Try this out. Go to <a href="https://szynalski.com/tone#E2,v0.75">https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator</a>. The frequency should already be set at 82.4 Hz.

Next, click the x2 button to double the frequency of the pitch. Do you notice what happens to the name of the tone? Then click the x1/2 button to halve the frequency. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/frequency-2x-or-half.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What is the frequency relationship between the pitches at E2 and E3?

## Part 2: Consonance in music means there are only 12 note names

You'll continue to notice this effect of consonance when you play any of the open strings and then play the 12th fret of that same string. The pitch at the 12th fret is in perfect consonance with the pitch of that same open string. 

The 12th fret is the same note but an __octave__ higher. 

Did you try out the tone generator? A pitch that has twice the frequency of another is exactly one octave higher. A pitch that has half the frequency of another is one octave lower. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Without knowing the names of all the notes on the guitar, you can play the note that is an octave higher. For example, play the note on the 3rd fret of the E string. 3 + 12 = 15. So next play the 15th fret of the E string. Notice that the note at the 15th fret sounds like a lighter shade of the note at the 3rd fret.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3-to-15.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here is a video of a cello droning on an "A". Here's a challenge for you. Without knowing anything about the guitar, can you find the note that is in perfect consonacne with the cellow? Obviously the A string is easy. But try to find other "A" notes on other strings like the E string or D string.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpQ6c0NotCY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If note names repeat every 12 frets, that means there are only 12 notes in total. 

Before we get into those note names, we need to next discuss The Major Scale first. It will reveal why we only use 7 letters of the alphabet instead of 12.

Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play any note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
3. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade" of the low E string (6th string) on the A string (5th string). Which fret does the higher "E" occur on the A string? Start on the 1st fret of the A string and go higher in pitch until you have found it.


## Part 2: The Major Scale creates a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/solfa.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Solfege Syllables is a way to sing the Major Scale without knowing the names of any notes.*

The Major Scale is probably the most important collection of notes that you will learn. We will use it to make music! Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians have come to the conclusion, over the course of thousands of years, that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes. But there is a specific order... 

To build the Major Scale, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Major Scale formula.*

Here's how to create the "palette" (the Major Scale) on the guitar:

1. Pick your first note. I chose the 8th fret of the low E string.
2. Move __2__ frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move __2__ frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move __1__ fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move __2__ frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move __2__ frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move __2__ frets and play the 19th fret.
8. Move __1__ fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are 7 notes. Remember that the two pitches that are 12 frets apart get the same name.*

You can use the formula anywhere on the guitar. Let's choose the 3rd fret of the low E string as our starting point.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. 3rd fret ("Do"), 5th fret ("Re"), and so on...*

Remember that the note at the 3rd fret is the same note as the 15th fret, just at an octave higher. So if you count the notes that result from the Major Scale pattern, then you will find it creates a "palette" of 7 notes.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?abc?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are only 7 notes. The last note is "1" again but at the higher "octave".*

__This is why there are 7 principle note names: A, B, C, D, E, F, G!__ It's all the Major Scale's fault.


Practice Exercises:

1. Play the Major scale on a single string starting on any fret that you wish.
2. Try using a droning note.

## Part 3: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

If "A" is the first note in the alphabet, shouldn't the first major scale be the A Major Scale? There's a long history as to why C is actually the first note that we create a Major scale from. It's kind of like asking "why is the color 'red' called 'red' at all?" Maybe in another universe the color red is actually called "Der". And maybe the 8th fret of the low E string is an "A". 

But that's not the case in this universe. The 8th fret of the low E string is a "C".

So let's take this diagram:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And label each note with its correct name. Start with C. Go up the alphabet. Once you reach G (the 7th note in the alphabet), loop back around to A. Like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is __actually__ C♮ (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is F♮ or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is G♮ or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after you reach G. This is called the C Major Scale because it starts with C:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. If C is on fret 8, we also know that fret 20 is also "C" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 7 of the low E string? (Hint: 7+12=19) Can you figure out what note is on fret 5? Fret 3? Fret 1?
2. Play the C major scale on the low E string. Say each note as you play it!
3. Play the C major scale on the A string (starting on the 3rd fret). Say each note as you play it!

## Part 4: Building the G Major Scale (intro to "sharps")

If you did Practice Exercise #1 in Part 3, then you discovered that fret 3 is the note "G". 

So let's use the Major Scale formula and mark each fret without naming it just yet. Starting on fret 3 (which we now know is "G"):

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Once you reach the 8th fret, you'll notice that it is similar to the C Major Scale. However, it deviates once you get to fret 14. In the C Major Scale, fret 13 is "F♮" and fret 15 is "G♮". So what note is fret 14? It is called F♯ (pronounced "F Sharp").

Here are the 2 rules for building a Major Scale.

1. It must follow the 221-2221 pattern.
2. It must represent each letter of the musical alphabet in its circular order.

Here is a diagram that shows both F♮ and F♯. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*F♮ is the 13th fret. F♯ is the 14th fret. You must use F♯ in the G Major Scale because it will fit in the 221-2221 pattern.*

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is G♮ (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short. 
3. Move __2__—The 7th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
4. Move __1__—The 8th fret is C♮ or just "C" for short.
5. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short.
6. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
7. Move __2__—The 14th fret is F♯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move __1__—The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Part 5: A pitch can have two names (intro to "flats")

The pitch that occurs at the 14th fret (F♯) has another name: G♭ (pronounced "G flat"). Yeah, this is kind of weird. The reason why G♭ is not used in the G Major Scale is because we need to fulfill rule number 2. If you use G♭ instead of F♯, then the scale would skip an "F" entirely. 

G, A, B, C, D, E, G♭, G. 

You can't do that. You have to include each letter. There are some other scales that will use G♭. We will build those later in this book.

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The 6th fret pitch has two names: A♯ and B♭.*

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move __2__—The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A.
4. Move __1__—The 6th fret has two names. A♯ or B♭. The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is B♭.
5. Move __2__—The 8th fret is C.
6. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D.
7. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E.
8. Move __1__—The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the G Major scale on the low E string and say each note.
2. Play the F Major scale on the low E string and say each note.

## Part 6: All 12 Notes and Their Names

You can see all 12 notes on the A string. These 12 notes are also on every other string as well. It's just easy to show on one string and not overload you with information.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/chromatic scale.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

__Remember:__ There is a half-step between ALL notes. However, the only two natural note pairs that are a half-step apart are E to F and B to C.

## Part 7: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

The 221-2221 formula can also be called WWH-WWWH. "W" represents a whole step (moving 2 frets). "H" represents a half step (moving just 1 fret).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-with-chromatic.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. We have chosen "C" to be our tonic.
2. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is D. 
3. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is E.
4. Move a __half step__, the next note in the scale is F.
5. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is G.
6. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is A.
7. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is B.
8. Move a __half step__, the final note in the scale is C again.

Because there are so many W's, I like to separate it like this WWH - W - WWH. There are 2 "WWH" pieces and they are "attached" with a "W" piece. Or you can just continue using the 221-2221 formula.

Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 9: The Minor Scale Formula

The Minor Scale Formula is 212-2122. Or WHW-WHWW (W = whole step and H = half step)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-minor-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret of the A string is B. 
3. Move __1__. The 3rd fret is C.
4. Move __2__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __1__. The 8th fret is F.
7. Move __2__. The 10th fret is G.
8. Move __2__. The 12th fret is A again. (Note: the open string is referred to as 0. 0 + 12 frets = 12th fret)

Why is it called minor? To see why it's called minor, we need to compare it to the A Major Scale. You will be able to see the difference when comparing the two.

Let's build the A Major scale:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-major-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret is B. 
3. Move __2__. The 4th fret is C♯. <- here is the first difference between the two scales
4. Move __1__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __2__. The 9th fret is F♯.
7. Move __2__. The 11th fret is G♯.
8. Move __1__. The 12th fret is A again.

| Scale Degree:  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Major Scale  | A  | B  | C♯ | D  | E  | F♯ | G♯ | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __4__  | 5  | 7  | 9  | 11 | 12 |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Minor Scale  | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __3__  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 10 | 12 |


The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is only 3 frets (half steps) apart in a Minor scale. 

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is larger. It is 4 frets (half steps) apart in a Major scale.

In music, the distance between two notes is called an __interval__. The interval that spans 3 notes is called a "Third". For example, A to C♯ is a "Third" and A to C is also a "Third". Both thirds span 3 note names (A, B, and C).

However, if it only takes 3 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a minor third. If it takes 4 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a major third.

As you can see above, the distance from A to C♯ is 4 half steps, thus Major. And the distance from A to C is just 3 half steps, which is smaller, and thus Minor.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ursa.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Think of constellations to understand Major vs Minor. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big" (a Major Third). Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small" (a Minor Third).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-vs-minor-scale-info.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale on the open A string and say each note.
2. Play the A Major scale on the open A string and say each note.

## Part 10: Exploring Thirds in the C Major Scale

A Major 3rd is a root tone and a tone __4__ half steps higher. A Minor 3rd is a root tone and a tone __3__ half steps higher. Both Third intervals will span 3 note names (like C to E).

With C as the root, C to E is a Major Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| C  | D♭ | D  | E♭ | E  |

As visualized on the guitar (C Major Scale on the A string starting on the 3rd fret):

With D as the root, D to F is a Minor Third:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| D  | E♭ | E  | F  |

As visualized on the guitar:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/d-to-f-3rd.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Part 11: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)

Triad is the most common type of "chord". "Tri" in triad means three. A triad is 2 third intervals put together. For example, C - E - G is called the C Major triad. The root note is C. The C-E third is a Major third. The E-G third is a Minor Third. It is called a Major Triad because the 1st Third is Major (C-E).

D - F - A is called the D Minor triad because the 1st Third is Minor (D-F). The 2nd Third is Major (F-A).

Triads contain both a Major Third and a Minor Third. However, Major triads will have the Major Third come first. In Minor triads, it is the opposite.

An easy way to build all the traids from a scale is to skip every note. C-E-G...D-F-A...and so on.

In root position, the C Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | C    | E   | G   |

In root position, the D Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | D    | F   | A   |

In root position, the E Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | E    | G   | B   |

In root position, the F Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | F    | A   | C   |

In root position, the G Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | G    | B   | D   |

In root position, the A Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | A    | C   | E   |


__Important thing to understand:__ Triads contain BOTH Major and Minor third intervals. The thing that distinguishes Major triads from Minor traids is how they are built.

## Part 12: The Diminished Triad

Major and Minor triads are each composed of a Major third and a Minor third. However, what if you were to create a chord that is composed of two minor thirds? This triad is called a Diminished triad and it happens naturally in every Major scale.

In root position, the B Diminished Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | B    | D   | F   |

B-D is a Minor third. D-F is a Minor third.

## Part 13: Numbering Each Chord - The Nashville Numbering System

All 7 triads in the key of C. R = root tone of the chord. 3 = the "third" of the chord. 5 = the "5th" of the chord. Because C is the first note in the scale, its chord is called the "one" chord but use roman numerals because we want to distinguish these numbers from the chord tone numbers.

| 5 | G | A  | B   | C  | D | E  | F    | 
| 3 | E | F  | G   | A  | B | C  | D    |
| R | C | D  | E   | F  | G | A  | B    |
| - | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |

A big Roman Numeral means that it is a Major chord. A small roman number means that it is a Minor chord. The vii° is the diminished chord.

In part 10, we found that there are 3 Major third dyads (another way of saying 2-note chord) in a Major key: C-E, F-A, and G-B. We also found that there are 4 Minor third dyads (D-F, E-G, A-C, B-D).

In parts 11 and 12, we then constructed the appropriate triad from each scale degree. We determined that chords built off of C, F, and G are Major. Chords built off of D, E, and A are Minor. And the chord built off of the B is diminished.

__Important thing to understand:__ A Major key produces chords that are Major, Minor, and diminished. It's called a Major key because the first chord is Major.
