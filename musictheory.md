## End Goal: Knowledge of Theory Gives You Confidence to Improvise and Compose Original Music

__This is a work in progress. Please email me with any questions: chrispaul.ws@gmail.com__

Many guitarists will start noodling around on their instrument after learning how to play several chords and riffs. This is a lot of fun to do. However, the real magic happens when you can improvise with other musicians. This is what separates the visual arts from music - creative collaboration. It is so much more fun to play with other musicians.

Basic music theory will give you the tools to understand how to fit your melodies over your bandmate's harmonies. Or, vice versa, it will show you how to create harmonies that fit with your bandmate's melodies.

If you're not in a band yet, you will learn how to improvise guitar riffs and melodies over any of your favorite songs.

But let's start simple. 

## Part 1: Why are two strings on the guitar both "E"?

Here are the names of the strings. I'm sure by now you have seen an image like this.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

How can two strings get the same name? The two E strings on the guitar obviously produce very different pitches. One is really high. One is really low. These two pitches are a lot like two shades of the same color. For example, dark red and light red are both considered red. It's the same thing with music.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/red.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

When you play both of the E strings at the same time you'll notice that they sound alike. They sound like they "just fit" together. This phenomenon is generally called consonance. And in this particular case, it is perfect consonance.

__Consonance__ is the impression of __stability__ while __dissonance__ is the impression of __tension__ or clash. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant, stable sound. If they don't, it's most likely that your guitar is not in tune.

#### Practice Assignment:

Go to <a href="https://szynalski.com/tone#E2,squ,v0.75">https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator</a>. The frequency should already be set at 82.4 Hz.

Next, click the x2 button to double the frequency of the pitch. Do you notice what happens to the name of the tone? Then click the x1/2 button to halve the frequency. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/frequency-2x-or-half.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What is the frequency relationship between the pitches at E2 and E3? What about E4? E5? And so on...

## Part 2: Consonance in music means there are only 12 note names

You'll continue to notice this effect of consonance when you play any of the open strings and then play the 12th fret of that same string. The pitch at the 12th fret is in perfect consonance with the pitch of that same open string. 

The 12th fret is the same note but an __octave__ higher. 

Did you try out the tone generator? A pitch that has twice the frequency of another is exactly one octave higher. A pitch that has half the frequency of another is one octave lower. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/eadgbe.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Without knowing the names of all the notes on the guitar, you can play the note that is an octave higher. For example, play the note on the 3rd fret of the E string. 3 + 12 = 15. So next play the 15th fret of the E string. Notice that the note at the 15th fret sounds like a lighter shade of the note at the 3rd fret. When you learn the name of the note at the 3rd fret, you will also know the name of the note that is 12 frets higher at the 15th fret.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3-to-15.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The dots above the 12th fret help you know what you are playing. They are the same notes but just an octave higher. For example, the first dot above the 12th fret (15th fret) has the same note name as the 3rd fret.*

__The important thing to understand:__ If notes repeat every 12 frets, that means there are only 12 note names in total. 

Before we get into those note names, we need to next discuss The Major Scale first. It will reveal why we only use 7 letters of the alphabet instead of 12.

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" (the octave higher) at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play each of the 12 notes from the open string to the 12th fret.
3. Play __any__ note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
4. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade" (the octave higher) of the low E string (6th string) on the A string (5th string). Which fret does the higher "E" occur on the A string? Start on the 1st fret of the A string and go higher in pitch until you have found it.


## Part 3: The Major Scale creates a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/solfa.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Solfege Syllables is a way to sing the Major Scale without knowing the names of any notes.*

The Major Scale is probably the most important collection of notes that you will learn. We will use it to make music! Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians have come to the conclusion, over the course of thousands of years, that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes. But there is a specific order... 

To build the Major Scale, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The Major Scale formula.*

Here's how to create the "palette" (the Major Scale) on the guitar:

1. Pick your first note. I chose the 8th fret of the low E string.
2. Move __2__ frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move __2__ frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move __1__ fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move __2__ frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move __2__ frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move __2__ frets and play the 19th fret.
8. Move __1__ fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are 7 notes. Remember that the two pitches that are 12 frets apart get the same name.*

You can use the formula anywhere on the guitar. Let's choose the 3rd fret of the low E string as our starting point.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Sing or hum the pitches as you play them. 3rd fret ("Do"), 5th fret ("Re"), and so on...*

Remember that the note at the 3rd fret is the same note as the 15th fret, just at an octave higher. So if you count the notes that result from the Major Scale pattern, then you will find it creates a "palette" of 7 notes.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?abc?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*There are only 7 notes. The last note is "1" again but at the higher "octave".*

__This is why there are 7 principle note names: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B!__ It's all the Major Scale's fault.

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the Major scale on a single string starting on any fret that you wish.
2. Try using a droning note. On youtube, search for "Cello droning note". If you find an "A" droning note, start you Major scale on the open A string.

## Part 4: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

If "A" is the first note in the alphabet, shouldn't the first major scale be the A Major Scale? There's a long history as to why C is actually the first note in the musical alphabet. It's kind of like asking "why is the color 'red' called 'red' at all?" Maybe in another universe the color red is actually called "Der". And maybe the first note in their musical alphabet is "A". 

But that's not the case in this universe. The 8th fret of the low E string produces a pitch at 130 Hz. As a society we have given this pitch the name of "C". 

So let's take this diagram:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And label each note with its correct name. Start with C. Go up the alphabet. Once you reach G (the 7th note in the alphabet), loop back around to A. Like so:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is __actually__ C♮ (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is F♮ or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is G♮ or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after you reach G. This is called the C Major Scale because it starts with C:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Because we are forced to follow the major scale pattern, some note names are right next to each other and some are a fret apart. 

#### Practice Exercises:

1. If C is on fret 8, we also know that fret 20 is also "C" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 7 of the low E string? (Hint: 7+12=19) Can you figure out what note is on fret 5? Fret 3? Fret 1?
2. Play the C major scale on the low E string. Say each note as you play it!
3. Play the C major scale on the A string (starting on the 3rd fret). Say each note as you play it!

## Part 5: Building the G Major Scale (intro to "sharps")

If you did Practice Exercise #1 in Part 3, then you discovered that fret 3 is the note "G". 

So let's use the Major Scale formula and mark each fret without naming it just yet. Starting on fret 3 (which we now know is "G"):

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmajor-scale-221-2221.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Once you reach the 8th fret, you'll notice that it is similar to the C Major Scale (frets 8, 10, and 12 are C, D, and E respectively). However, it deviates once you get to fret 14. In the C Major Scale, fret 13 is "F♮" and fret 15 is "G♮". So what note is fret 14? It is called F♯ (pronounced "F Sharp").

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*F♮ is the 13th fret. F♯ is the 14th fret. You must use F♯ in the G Major Scale because of the 2 Major Scale Rules.*

Here are the 2 rules for building a Major Scale.

1. It must follow the 221-2221 pattern.
2. It must represent each letter of the musical alphabet in its circular order.

Build the G Major Scale:

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is G♮ (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short. 
3. Move __2__—The 7th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
4. Move __1__—The 8th fret is C♮ or just "C" for short.
5. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short.
6. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
7. Move __2__—The 14th fret is F♯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move __1__—The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Practice Exercises:

1. If G is on fret 3, we also know that fret 15 is also "G" (just at a higher pitch) because it is 12 frets away. Can you work out what note is on fret 2 of the low E string?
2. Play the G major scale on the low E string and __SING__ each note as you play it!

## Part 6: A pitch can have two names (intro to "flats")

The pitch that occurs at the 14th fret (F♯) has another name: G♭ (pronounced "G flat"). Yeah, this is kind of weird. The reason why G♭ is not used in the G Major Scale is because we need to fulfill rule number 2. If you use G♭ instead of F♯, then the scale would skip an "F" entirely. 

This is wrong: G, A, B, C, D, E, G♭, G. 

You can't do that. You have to include each letter. 

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat note. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The 6th fret pitch has two names: A♯ and B♭. If your scale already uses an A, then you must use B♭.*

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move __2__—The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move __2__—The 5th fret is A.
4. Move __1__—The 6th fret has two names. A♯ or B♭. The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is B♭.
5. Move __2__—The 8th fret is C.
6. Move __2__—The 10th fret is D.
7. Move __2__—The 12th fret is E.
8. Move __1__—The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png?abc){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the F Major scale on the low E string and sing each note but an octave higher.

## Part 7: All 12 Notes and Their Names. The Chromatic Scale

From C to C, here are the names of all 12 notes. Underneath each note, you'll see the fret number of the low E string. There are two rows because each flat/sharp note has two names.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/all12notes.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here is C to C on the A string. I have labeled the fret numbers under each note.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-on-a-string.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

__Remember:__ There is a half-step between ALL notes. However, the only two natural note pairs that are a half-step apart are E to F and B to C.

## Part 8: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

The 221-2221 formula can also be called WWH-WWWH. "W" represents a whole step (moving 2 frets). "H" represents a half step (moving just 1 fret).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-with-chromatic.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. We have chosen "C" to be our tonic.
2. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is D. 
3. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is E.
4. Move a __half step__, the next note in the scale is F.
5. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is G.
6. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is A.
7. Move a __whole step__ (2 half steps), the next note in the scale is B.
8. Move a __half step__, the final note in the scale is C again.

Because there are so many W's, I like to separate it like this WWH - W - WWH. There are 2 "WWH" pieces and they are "attached" with a "W" piece. Or you can just continue using the 221-2221 formula.



#### Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 9: The Minor Scale Formula

The Minor Scale Formula is 212-2122. Or WHW-WHWW (W = whole step and H = half step)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-minor-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret of the A string is B. 
3. Move __1__. The 3rd fret is C.
4. Move __2__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __1__. The 8th fret is F.
7. Move __2__. The 10th fret is G.
8. Move __2__. The 12th fret is A again. (Note: the open string is referred to as 0. 0 + 12 frets = 12th fret)

Why is it called minor? To see why it's called minor, we need to compare it to the A Major Scale. You will be able to see the difference when comparing the two.

Let's build the A Major scale:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-major-scale-on-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move __2__. The 2nd fret is B. 
3. Move __2__. The 4th fret is C♯. <- here is the first difference between the two scales
4. Move __1__. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move __2__. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move __2__. The 9th fret is F♯.
7. Move __2__. The 11th fret is G♯.
8. Move __1__. The 12th fret is A again.

| Scale Degree:  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Major Scale  | A  | B  | C♯ | D  | E  | F♯ | G♯ | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __4__  | 5  | 7  | 9  | 11 | 12 |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A Minor Scale  | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | A  |
| Fret Number:   | 0  | 2  | __3__  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 10 | 12 |


The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is only 3 frets (half steps) apart in a Minor scale. 

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is larger. It is 4 frets (half steps) apart in a Major scale.

In music, the distance between two notes is called an __interval__. The interval that spans 3 notes is called a "Third". For example, A to C♯ is a "Third" and A to C is also a "Third". Both thirds span 3 note names (A, B, and C).

However, if it only takes 3 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a minor third. If it takes 4 half steps to traverse from the first note (the root note) to the next note in the interval pair, then the interval is considered a major third.

As you can see above, the distance from A to C♯ is 4 half steps, thus Major. And the distance from A to C is just 3 half steps, which is smaller, and thus Minor.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ursa.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Think of constellations to understand the Major and Minor designations. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big" (a Major Third). Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small" (a Minor Third).

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-vs-minor-scale-info.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale on the open A string and say each note.
2. Play the A Major scale on the open A string and say each note.

## Part 10: Exploring Thirds in the C Major Scale

A Major 3rd is a root tone and a tone __4__ half steps higher. A Minor 3rd is a root tone and a tone __3__ half steps higher. Both Third intervals will span 3 note names (like C to E).

Here are all Third Intervals in the C Major scale.

| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 3rd:  |  E |  F |  G |  A |  B |  C |  D |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Root:  |  C |  D |  E |  F |  G |  A |  B |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

But which ones are Major and which ones are Minor? Let's explore...

With C as the root, C to E is a Major Third:

## Part 11: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)

Triad is the most common type of "chord". "Tri" in triad means three. A triad is 2 third intervals put together. For example, C - E - G is called the C Major triad. The root note is C. The C-E third is a Major third. The E-G third is a Minor Third. It is called a Major Triad because the 1st Third is Major (C-E).

D - F - A is called the D Minor triad because the 1st Third is Minor (D-F). The 2nd Third is Major (F-A).

Triads contain both a Major Third and a Minor Third. However, Major triads will have the Major Third come first. In Minor triads, it is the opposite.

An easy way to build all the traids from a scale is to skip every other note in the scale. C-E-G...D-F-A...and so on.

The C Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | C    | E   | G   |

The D Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | D    | F   | A   |

The E Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | E    | G   | B   |

The F Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | F    | A   | C   |

The G Major Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | G    | B   | D   |

The A Minor Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | A    | C   | E   |

### The Perfect 5th

All Major and minor triads contain a perfect 5th interval from the root note to the 5th. A perfect 5th is defined as spanning 5 note names and traversing 7 half steps. Here are two quick examples that show the distance from C to G and from D to A.

| Half steps traversed: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 |

__Important thing to understand:__ Triads contain BOTH Major and Minor third intervals. The thing that distinguishes Major triads from Minor traids is how they are built.

## Part 12: The Diminished Triad

Major and Minor triads are each composed of a Major third and a Minor third. However, what if you were to create a chord that is composed of two minor thirds? This triad is called a Diminished triad and it happens naturally in every Major scale.

The B Diminished Triad is composed of 3 notes:

| Interval Name:  | Root | 3rd | 5th |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Chord Tones:    | B    | D   | F   |

B-D is a Minor third. D-F is a Minor third.

The interval from the root note to the 5th is called a diminished 5th because only 6 half steps are traversed.

| Half steps traversed: | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 | 6 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Notes: | B  | C | D♭  | D | E♭  | E | F |

Remember: a perfect 5th interval is 7 half steps apart.

## Part 13: Numbering Each Chord - The Nashville Numbering System

All 7 triads in the key of C. R = root tone of the chord. 3 = the "third" of the chord. 5 = the "5th" of the chord. Because C is the first note in the scale, its chord is called the "one" chord but use roman numerals because we want to distinguish these numbers from the chord tone numbers.

| 5 | G | A  | B   | C  | D | E  | F    | 
| 3 | E | F  | G   | A  | B | C  | D    |
| R | C | D  | E   | F  | G | A  | B    |
| - | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |

A big Roman Numeral means that it is a Major chord. A small roman number means that it is a Minor chord. The vii° is the diminished chord.

In part 10, we found that there are 3 Major third dyads (another way of saying 2-note chord) in a Major key: C-E, F-A, and G-B. We also found that there are 4 Minor third dyads (D-F, E-G, A-C, B-D).

In parts 11 and 12, we then constructed the appropriate triad from each scale degree. We determined that chords built off of C, F, and G are Major. Chords built off of D, E, and A are Minor. And the chord built off of the B is diminished.

__Important thing to understand:__ A Major key produces chords that are Major, Minor, and diminished. It's called a Major key because the first chord is Major.

## Part 14: Improvisation for Beginners. Applying Theory to Make Music.

There are a few ways to cross the river. You don't have to use any of the stepping stones. Let's assume that the river isn't that deep. You could just wade through the water. But just know that you will get wet. 

Maybe you'll try your best to use the stones but sometimes you will slip off. You only get a little wet.

And finally, you could cross the river by stepping on the stones and never getting wet at all.

When I began learning how to improvise, I was told to play whatever I felt like. After the end of my solo, it seem liked I just fell in the river. It honestly wasn't very fun. I didn't really know what I was doing. I was told: "Here's a scale. Just use the notes in the scale!"

Later, my teachers told me about the stepping stones. In music, they are called "chord tones". I knew they were there. But I just didn't quite understand how to use them in my solos. Chord tones are the individual notes that make up a chord. Instead of "playing whatever you want" and getting "soaking wet", you should begin to understand how to rely on chord tones. It's a logical method because it provides a straightforward path for you to follow. You will be improvising which path to take. And the more you get comfortable with the paths you take, you can begin to get your feet wet with using other tools (like notes from scales).

#### How to stay "dry" when improvising a melody (ie. soloing)

Songs are made up of harmonies (chords) and melodies (vocals and/or instrumental solos). Here is a common chord progression in the key of C that is similar to Let It Be by The Beatles

C - G - Am - F.

Here are the chord tones for each chord:

| 5 | G | D  | E  | C  |
| 3 | E | B  | C  | A  |
| R | C | G  | A  | F  |
| - | I | V  | vi | IV |

The next step is to visually see where these chord tones are in the C Major scale. I will put 4 columns of the C Major scale and highlight each chord within the scale. The numbers on the left are the scale degree.

| 7 | B | __B__  | B  | B  |
| 6 | A | A  | __A__  | __A__  |
| 5 | __G__ | __G__  | G  | G  |
| 4 | F | F  | F  | __F__  |
| 3 | __E__ | E  | __E__  | E  |
| 2 | D | __D__  | D  | D  |
| 1 | __C__ | C  | __C__  | __C__  |
| - | I (C) | V (G) | vi (Am) | IV (F) |
