## Intro: You shouldn't JUST "play by ear". You need some music theory (ie. knowledge)

Basic music theory is not complicated. Most music teachers struggle teaching it however. Once you understand the fundamental patterns, everything will make sense because everything in music is connected. I will do my best to break down each concept into individual bite-sized pieces. 

It may seem like I explain things a little differently than other teachers. That's because I teach a class of 14-year old student guitarists each fall. If they can understand theory, I know for a fact that you can too.


## Part 1: Notes are like colors

Sometimes, it can be useful to compare music to art. Painters can use just a few colors to make a beautiful painting. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/palette-painting.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Artists can mix paints to create new colors. Musicians can do the same thing by playing multiple notes at the same time. When musicians make music with single notes which is one aspect of "melody". 

Give it a try: play a one note on your high E string (the string closest to your toes). You can start on the open string, then play up the fretboard on each fret (as high as you'd like!) and then come back down and finish on the open high E string.

When musicians combine notes and play them at the same time, that is often called "harmony". Most beginners start with learning how to play harmony with common open-position chords like E minor. Here is the E minor shape that you can strum:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-minor-shape.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Like colors, each pitch that is produced by an instrument has a name. However, in art, some colors are considered "dark" or "light" depending on their brightness. However, the colors "dark red" and "light red" are both called red. The same thing happens in music. You can hear this interesting phenomenon on the guitar when you play each note on the A string.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/a-to-a2.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

If you play each and every fret on the A string, you'll notice that when you reach the 12th fret, this note "just fits" with the first note played at the open string (the A string). Try playing the 12th fret of the A string while this Cello is "droning" on their "A".

This is why we call the note at the 12th fret "A" as well. No, it is NOT the same note...it just has the same name. One "A" is higher in pitch than the other "A".

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-e-fretboard.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

You can also hear this phenomenon when you play the 1st string (the one closest to your toes) and the 6th string (the one closest to your nose) at the same time. Both of these strings produce an "E". They should sound like they "fit". If the harmony made from playing these two notes sound slightly "off", then perhaps one of your strings needs to be tuned!

Definitions to learn: consonance is the impression of stability and repose while dissonance is the impression of tension or clash as experienced by a listener when certain combinations of tones or notes are sounded together. Playing your two E strings on the guitar should create a consonant sound (stable).

Before we discuss the names of the notes, remember this important fact: there are only 12 note names. There's something that we need to discuss first before I list all 12 note names—The Major Scale.

Practice Exercises:

1. Play each open string and also play its "lighter shade" at the 12th fret on the same string.
2. Play any note and find its "lighter shade" at exactly 12 frets higher. For example, play the 1st fret on the E string and then play the 13th fret.
3. Use your ear to find the "ligher shade. on the next string. For example, play the low E string. Can you find its "lighter shade" note on the A string?

## Part 2: The Major Scale is a palette of 7 "colors"

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/221-2221.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The Major Scale is probably the most important scale that you will learn. Due to cultural reasons and also the Ancient Greeks, musicians, over the course of thousands of years, have come to the conclusion that one of the best "palettes" of notes we can use to "paint" a song only requires 7 notes.

To find out which notes go onto our palette, there is a simple formula to learn. It's easy to remember because it's like a phone number (see above). Here's how to create the "palette":

1. Pick your first note—how about the 8th fret of the low E string (or 3rd fret of the A string).
2. Move 2 frets. Play the 10th fret. This is the next note in the palette (scale).
3. Move 2 frets. Play the 12th fret.
4. Move 1 fret. Play the 13th fret.
5. Move 2 frets and play the 15th fret.
6. Move 2 frets and play the 17th fret.
7. Move 2 frets and play the 19th fret.
8. And finally, move 1 fret and play the 20th fret to complete the scale. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Definitions to learn: the first note in a scale is called the Tonic. 

In music theory, the scale degree is the position of a particular note on a scale relative to the tonic. Each degree is the number given to each step of the scale: 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/major-scale-pattern-rainbow.png?2272022){: .mx-auto.d-block :}



Practice Exercises:

1. Play the Major scale on a single string starting on any fret that you wish.
2. Try using a droning note.

## Part 3: The First Major Scale to learn is The C Major Scale

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 8th fret of the low E string is the note C. It's full legal name is C♮ (pronounced "C Natural"). However, if you say just "C", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short. 
3. The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.
4. The 13th fret is F♮ or just "F" for short.
5. The 15th fret is G♮ or just "G" for short.
6. The 17th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short.
7. The 19th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
8. The 20th fret is C again. (Note: 8th fret + 12 frets = 20th fret)

You'll notice that the scale will contain each letter name and loop back to A after the G. 

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-major-scale-rainbow.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I don't know why the first major isn't A Major. There is a lot of history to how music has developed over the years. What's interesting is the first note on the piano is an A (the farthest left/lowest note). What's interesting is that A is the first minor scale. We will discuss minor scales in Part 6.

You can choose a different "Tonic" and create a new palette of notes. For example, let's choose "G" as our tonic and apply the 221-2221 formula. When starting on the 3rd fret, you'll notice some of the notes overlap the C Major Scale.

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the C major scale on the low E string. Say each note as you play it!
2. Play the C major scale on the A string (starting on the 3rd fret). Say each note as you play it!

## Part 4: The other notes: sharps and flats

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-c-major-frets-gmajor.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 3rd fret of the low E string is the note G. It's full legal name is G♮ (pronounced "G Natural"). However, if you say just "G", then all musicians understand that the "natural" part is implied.
2. Move 2—The 5th fret is A♮ or just "A" for short. 
3. Move 2—The 7th fret is B♮ or just "B" for short.
4. Move 1—The 8th fret is C♮ or just "C" for short.
5. Move 2—The 10th fret is D♮ or just "D" for short.
6. Move 2—The 12th fret is E♮ or just "E" for short.

Here I left both F♮ and F♯ labeled on the fretboard so that you can see the difference. We're at the part of the formula where we move 2. So this means we'll land on the 14th fret which is in between F♮ and G♮. The note on the 14th fret is F♯ (pronounced "F sharp"). When building a Major Scale, you must include all 7 letters. Then we have "sharps" (or "flats") to handle these scenarios where the formula leads us to notes that are in between the "natural" notes.

7. Move 2—The 14th fret is F♯. If your scale has a "sharp" note, you must always call it by its full name.
8. Move 1—The 15th fret is G again. (Note: 3rd fret + 12 frets = 15th fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/g-major-scale-rainbow.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What About Flats?

Ok, let's pick a scale that has a flat. Start on the 1st fret of the low E string. This note is F. Do you remember the C Major scale? What was the note that came right after the 12th fret? (Note: 13th fret - 12 frets = 1st fret)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-f-major-scale.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The 1st fret of the low E string is the note F.
2. Move 2—The 3rd fret is G. 
3. Move 2—The 5th fret is A.
4. Move 1—The 6th fret has two names. A♯ or B♭ (pronounced "B Flat"). The scale already has an A (5th fret), so the correct name to use is B♭.
5. Move 2—The 8th fret is C.
6. Move 2—The 10th fret is D.
7. Move 2—The 12th fret is E.
8. Move 1—The 13th fret is F again.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/f-major-scale-rainbow.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the G Major scale on the low E string and say each note.
2. Play the F Major scale on the low E string and say each note.

## Part 5: Whole Steps and Half Steps

The 221-2221 formula describes how big of a step you move from one note to the next. A half step is the smallest step that you can take. You only move 1 fret with a half-step. A whole step is 2 half-steps. 

Practice Exercises:

1. When playing any Major scale, say which step you are about to do.

## Part 6: The Minor Scale Formula and "Major vs minor"

The Minor Scale Formula is 212-2122. Or WHW-WHWW (W = whole step and H = half step)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-a-minor.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move 2. The 2nd fret of the A string is B. 
3. Move 1. The 3rd fret is C.
4. Move 2. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move 2. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move 1. The 8th fret is F.
7. Move 2. The 10th fret is G.
8. Move 2. The 12th fret is A again. (Note: the open string is referred to as 0. 0 + 12 frets = 12th fret)

Why is it called minor? To see why it's called minor, let's build the A Major scale.

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-a-major.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

1. The open string "A" is our first note (the Tonic).
2. Move 2. The 2nd fret is B. 
3. Move 2. The 4th fret is C♯. <- here is the first difference between the two scales
4. Move 1. The 5th fret is D.
5. Move 2. The 7th fret is E.
6. Move 2. The 9th fret is F♯.
7. Move 2. The 11th fret is G♯.
8. Move 1. The 12th fret is A again.

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is only 3 frets (or 3 half-steps) in a Minor scale.

The distance from the 1st note to the 3rd note is 4 frets (or 4 half-steps) in a Major scale.

Think of constellations to understand Major vs Minor. The Big Dipper is called Ursa Major because it's bigger. The Little Dipper is called Ursa Minor because it's smaller. Major Scales are major because the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes is "big". Whereas the interval between the 1st and 3rd notes in a minor scale is "small".

Practice Exercises:

1. Play the A minor scale on the open A string and say each note.
2. Play the A Major scale on the open A string and say each note.

## Part 7: The Two Ways to Count In Music

When counting notes, always start from 1. For example, what is the 5th note above A? It is E because you start counting on 1 and A is 1 (in this example).

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | A |

In music, we say "E is a 5th above A."

What is the 3rd note above G? It is B because G is 1 in this example.

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| G | A | B | C | D | E | F | G |

B is a third above G.

When counting half-steps, always start from 0. For example, let's take the A to E example. How many half-steps apart are those notes? It's easy to see this on the guitar. Look at the A Major scale here:

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fretboard-counting-halfsteps.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

E is on the 7th fret. Start on A (the open string) and that letter is 0. The next fret is 1. And so on.




## Part 8: Major Thirds vs. Minor Thirds (Dyads)

We've learned that scales can be Major or Minor. So can intervals. In the example, above I said that "B" is a third above G. But more accurately I should have said B♮ is a Major 3rd from G. There is another note with "B" in its name: B♭. It also is a 3rd above G but you only need to traverse 3 half-steps to get to B♭. Look at the G string on the fret board. B♮ is on the 4th fret. B♭ is on the 3rd fret.


| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| G  | A♭ | A  | B♭ | B♮ |

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - | - | - |
| G | A | B |

Major Third = Spans 3 notes and traverses 4 half-steps.
Minor Third = Spans 3 notes and traverses 3 half-steps.

G to B is a Major Third because the interval spans 3 note names and is 4 half-steps apart.
G to B♭ is a Minor Third because the interval spans 3 notes names is 3 half-steps apart.

Play a G major barre chord. Your 2nd finger plays the B. Take your 2nd finger off to play the G Minor barre chord. Now, your barred finger is playing the B♭ on the 3rd fret.

Definition to know: a dyad is a harmony composed of just two notes.

Definition to know: the "root" is the base note in the harmony. In the examples above, G is the "root" and B or B♭ is the "third".

## Part 9: Major Triads vs. Minor Triads (3 Note Chords)
