# For this class, we will play in the "casual/folk style", not "classical style"

Casual or "Folk" Style is where you rest the guitar on your right leg:

Classical Style requires that you have a foot rest for your left foot. You also rest the guitar on your left leg:

Some tips: 

* If you sit all the way back in your seat, you may need to cross your legs to elevate the guitar.
* If you sit on the edge of your seat, you may need to prop up your heel against the leg of the chair.
  * Or you could try a foot rest underneath your right foot.
* Try not to let the headstock droop.
* Leaning the guitar back to see where you fingers go is fine as a temporary measure. But try to get back into an upright position as much as possible. 


# We will learn to use a "pick" and the "finger style"

Both styles are fun and that's why we learn both. Please purchase extra picks! Here is a good option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-Acoustic-Variety-Guitar-PVP112/dp/B0752M4GLM/">https://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-Acoustic-Variety-Guitar-PVP112/dp/B0752M4GLM</a>

How To Strum with a Pick

__Important thing to remember:__ a good strumming sound just takes time to develop. Over the past 3 years, I have noticed that it is totally normal for students to not sound that great the first week. Don't judge yourself! Just follow the exercises and things will naturally fall into place over the next two months.

It will take time to understand how firm you should hold the pick. My best advice is to listen to a good acoustic player and try to mimic what they do. You may drop the pick into the soundhole as you learn. That's common and totally normal.

You can decrease the chances of the pick falling into the soundhole of the guitar if you keep the guitar perpendicular to the ground.

# Important Guitar Parts to Know

__The Fretboard and Frets&mdash;__ The fretboard is where you will place your left hand fingers. The frets are the pieces of wire that are inserted into the fingerboard. Each fret is numbered. For example, you'll notice that you'll have a dot that is "inlayed" into the fingerboard "on" the 3rd fret (as well as the 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and more...). 

The dot is not literally "on" the fret but in the space just left of the fret. When we say "play the 3rd fret", what we really mean is to place a finger in that space just to the left of the 3rd fret.

__Tuning Machines or "tuners"&mdash;__ You will always turn the tuner to the left to increase the tension of a string. 

It's true!

This is still the case for the tuners on the "bottom" side. If you lay the guitar flat, walk around to the bottom side and look at the headstock, you will notice that the tuners on this side also turn left to increase tension of the strings.

You'll typically need to tighten each string just a little bit each day because the strings will lose tension over night.

__The Nut&mdash;__ is the plastic or bone piece between the headstock and the fretboard where the strings rest in 6 slots.

__The Saddle&mdash;__ is the other plastic or bone piece at the other end of the guitar where the strings rest. But there are no slots for each individual string.

# Why really cheap guitars are no fun to play

Sometimes the neck on a really cheap guitar is curved a little too much away from you (called a "forward bow"). Additionally, the nut and saddle may be too tall. All of these factors cause the strings to be too far away from the fretboard (aka "string action is too high") which makes playing the guitar a miserable experience.

These can be fixed by a local guitar for shop. Expect to pay at least $65 to fix these issues however.
