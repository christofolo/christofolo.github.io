# On Day 1 we just review the syllabus, talk about the summer, and fill out a "Get To Know You" survey

Almost no students bring their guitar to class on the first day of school. So we just go over what they'll learn and the supplies that they will need. However, I do briefly demonstrate how to tune a string (increasing/decreasing string tension). But they will learn how to tune their guitar tomorrow...which leads me to the very first Music Theory Lesson of the year:

# Why are there two "E" Strings anyway?

In art, all of the colors get a name. 

<center><p style="color:red;font-size:36px;font-weight:bold;">This color is red.</p></center>

Further though, a color can have a darker shade and a lighter shade.

<center><p style="color:#CC0000;font-size:36px;font-weight:bold;">This color is darker but still considered red.</p></center>

<center><p style="color:#ff6666;font-size:36px;font-weight:bold;">This color is lighter but still considered red.</p></center>

A similar thing happens in music. We've given names to all the pitches that an instrument makes. Pitches can be low (like a darker shade) when you play the 6th string (the one closest to your nose). Or pitches can be high (like a lighter shade) when you play the 1st string (the one closest to your toes). When you learn how to tune your guitar tomorrow, you'll notice that there are two pitches (when playing the 1st and 6th strings) that get the same name ("E"). 

I don't want to get too deep into the explanation just yet. For now, just remember that when two notes have the same name, it's similar to color. Notes (named pitches) are kind of like colors and shades of colors.

# Try it out for yourself! 

I bet you can predict when two notes will have the same name.

1. Play any open string.
2. On that same string, play the note at the 12th fret.
3. Do those two notes sound alike in some way? How would you describe that?

Try this:

1. Play the 3rd fret of any string (the 1st dot).
2. Play the the 15th fret of that same string (the 1st dot that is past the double dots).
3. What do you notice?
