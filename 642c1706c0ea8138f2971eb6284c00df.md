# What is a Chord?

When we play a single string, we are just playing one single note. But we can also play multiple strings at the same time.

A chord is where you play at least 3 distinct notes at the same time. When you play just 3 notes, that chord is called a triad. One way to play a triad is to arpeggiate it. This is what we did on Day 2 with Exercise 4. We arpeggiated the "E minor" chord. Its chord symbol is "Em".

Definitions Review&mdash;Memorize these!

* Chord&mdash;three or more single pitches heard simultaneously.
* Triad&mdash;a chord of just 3 notes.
* To Arpeggiate&mdash;play a chord in which individual notes are struck one by one, rather than all together at once. (Arpeggio, n.)
* Chord Symbol&mdash;A symbolic representation of the chord quality. Example: "Em".

What is the "T"? The thumb wraps around and mutes the low E string. If you're playing on a classical guitar, the neck is probably too big to do this.

## G6

## The so-called "Zombie Chord"

If you watch The Cranberries perform live (below), then you'll notice that the leader singer plays the 4th chord like this. Many online tab sites suggest a different chord but that's not what she does. Plus it's easier to play!
