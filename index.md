Follow along with my Beginning Guitar High School course that starts on August 15, 2022. We start from the very beginning and by week 8 we are playing along with Hotel California! All you have to do is show up.

## Suggested Materials

* A tuner like this one <a href="https://www.daddario.com/products/accessories/tuners/eclipse-headstock-tuner-multi">https://www.daddario.com/products/accessories/tuners/eclipse-headstock-tuner-multi</a>
* My students can't use their phones during class. But you can obviously. I like to use the "insTuner" app. A lot of people also like the "Guitar Tuna" app. 
* You will need a capo. I recommend this brand: <a href="https://shubb.com/product-category/capos/steel-string-guitar">https://shubb.com/product-category/capos/steel-string-guitar</a> because you don't need to squeeze it. It's very easy to put on.
* I recommend extra light gauge strings. But it's not absolutely necessary to change your strings. They are much easier to play than 12s if you decided to replace them. <a href="https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/acoustic-guitar/8020-bronze/ej10-8020-bronze-acoustic-guitar-strings-extra-light-10-47">https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/acoustic-guitar/8020-bronze/ej10-8020-bronze-acoustic-guitar-strings-extra-light-10-47</a>

## Release Any Goals and Expectations of Yourself

Sometimes lofty goals get in the way of our progress. Sounds strange, right? There can be a large gap between where we currently are and where lofty goals tell us where we should go. 

The more primitive part of our brains can only decipher what we are capabale of doing in the moment. If the gap between what we can do in the moment and what the goal says is **too large**, you may feel emotions of aprehensiveness, dread, wary, ambivalence, hesitance, lost, perplex, torn, self-conscious, anxiousness, discouraged, or overwhelm. 

And this is why procrastination gives us relief. 

Some people have a lot of willpower that allows them to tolerate negative emotions for a longer period of time. The rest of us don't and so the guilt causes us to create even loftier goals. You go for a while but then it's just too much to handle and you fall off again. The cycle continues.

When you get an email from me, I want you to release any and all expectations. Imagine that your neighborhood has a music school. Imagine packing up your guitar and walking over to the class. Imagine getting set up and tuning your guitar and just waiting for class to start. Your only job is to just play along. You don't have to do anything but show up.

I understand that some of the songs won't be your favorite. Think of it as an opportunity to learn a song that someone else might ask you to play for them. But if you have any suggestions, please let me know. Maybe I can include a song that you love into my class!

You can visit this page each day to see updates. Or you can email me at chrispaul.ws@gmail.com. I will then email you when I post a new lesson.
