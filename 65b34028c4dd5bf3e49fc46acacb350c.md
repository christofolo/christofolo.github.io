# New Chord!

"EM" is pronounced "E Major". However MOST everyone leaves off the big "M" so that it is just "E". It is still pronounced "E Major".

Chord symbols that you should know so far: Em (E Minor), CMaj7, G6, and now E (E Major).

# Strumming Level 1

During week 1, we practiced strumming down. We'll now incorporate an upstrum. Here is the strumming pattern visualized into "boxes". There are 4 boxes with one box that is divided into two. Each box represents the beat of the song. On the last beat, you will divide the beat into two so that you can play a down strum and an up strum in a single beat.

Listen to how this sounds.

The most important aspect of this strumming level practice is to tap your foot on the down beat! 

__TO DO:__ Review last week's chords and practice this strumming pattern while tapping your foot! Tapping your foot is the most important part!
